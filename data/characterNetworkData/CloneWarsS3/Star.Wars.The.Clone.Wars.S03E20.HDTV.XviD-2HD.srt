00:00:16,536 --> 00:00:18,180
Trapped behind enemy lines!

3
00:00:18,214 --> 00:00:21,316
Carrying secret information,
vital to the Republic's war

4
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:26,388
effort, jedi master Even Piell and captain
Tarkin were taken prisoner by the separatists.

5
00:00:26,422 --> 00:00:29,424
An elite strike team
led by Obi-Wan Kenobi

6
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:32,561
and Anakin Skywalker landed
on the planet, Lola Sayu,

7
00:00:32,595 --> 00:00:34,696
and infiltrated the prison.

8
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,732
The team rescued master Piell
and Tarkin, but they were

9
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:41,403
pursued by the prison's
evil commandant, Osi Sobeck.

10
00:00:41,437 --> 00:00:44,172
During the escape,
their ship was destroyed.

11
00:00:44,207 --> 00:00:49,878
Now we find them on the run, desperate
to escape the trap that is The Citadel.

12
00:00:54,817 --> 00:00:56,918
We're clear!

13
00:01:00,423 --> 00:01:02,157
What's our next move?

14
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:04,526
We're going to have to
fight our way off this rock.

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,827
Contact the Council.

16
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:08,029
See when they plan to rescue us.

17
00:01:08,064 --> 00:01:10,398
I'll handle it.

18
00:01:13,436 --> 00:01:16,371
Master Piell, it's good to
see you alive, my friend.

19
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:19,608
Likewise, master windu.
Our escape route has been

20
00:01:19,642 --> 00:01:23,778
compromised, and there are several
squads of droids closing in on us.

21
00:01:23,813 --> 00:01:26,181
When can we expect your arrival?

22
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:28,383
Master Plo is already en route.

23
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:31,553
Gunships will arrive to
evacuate you and your men,

24
00:01:31,587 --> 00:01:34,322
but do not delay, only a small window of

25
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:36,057
opportunity shall we have.

26
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:39,961
Your rendezvous point will be this island.

27
00:01:39,996 --> 00:01:41,529
Understood.

28
00:01:41,564 --> 00:01:44,599
May the force be with you.

29
00:01:51,173 --> 00:01:53,341
Incoming!

30
00:02:07,657 --> 00:02:11,726
No doubt, there's more on the way.

31
00:02:23,372 --> 00:02:26,374
Count Dooku, my lord.

32
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:30,679
Commander Sobeck, you've been
avoiding my transmissions.

33
00:02:30,713 --> 00:02:33,748
My deepest respect.

34
00:02:33,783 --> 00:02:37,619
I was hoping to surprise
you with good news.

35
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:42,490
Good news would indeed be a surprise.

36
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:44,626
Have the prisoners been captured?

37
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,563
Not yet, my lord, but we've
located their position and my

38
00:02:48,597 --> 00:02:50,966
droids are moving in now.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,069
I need not remind you that
the prisoners are carrying

40
00:02:54,103 --> 00:02:57,739
secret hyperspace coordinates
into the core systems of the

41
00:02:57,773 --> 00:03:01,876
Republic and our Separatist homeworlds.

42
00:03:01,911 --> 00:03:04,746
This information will allow
us to launch a surprise attack

43
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,983
on coruscant, striking
a crippling blow to the

44
00:03:08,017 --> 00:03:11,086
Republic and the jedi.

45
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,021
Yes, my lord.

46
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:16,891
I will see to it that they are
soon back in our possession.

47
00:03:16,926 --> 00:03:21,062
You should know, commander,
right now your honesty is the

48
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:24,299
only thing keeping you alive.

49
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:40,749
They're boxing us in!

50
00:03:40,783 --> 00:03:42,584
Lock in your cables!

51
00:03:42,618 --> 00:03:45,653
Artoo, we need your droids
to hold off the enemy as long

52
00:03:45,688 --> 00:03:46,488
as possible.

53
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,525
Good, everybody follow me!

54
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:55,163
This is sheer madness!

55
00:03:59,368 --> 00:04:01,002
We understand, sir.

56
00:04:01,037 --> 00:04:03,605
We will delay the enemy
as long as possible.

57
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,776
Prepare for attack.

58
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,312
It was an honor to serve under you, sir.

59
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:15,683
Keep moving!

60
00:04:15,718 --> 00:04:21,089
All for one and one
for a...

61
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:37,972
Keep moving, keep moving!

62
00:04:53,656 --> 00:04:57,358
Master Tiin, you should be
leading the fighter attack.

63
00:04:57,393 --> 00:05:00,728
Once you punch a hole through
their defenses, I will lead the

64
00:05:00,763 --> 00:05:03,598
gunships down to the
surface and extract the team.

65
00:05:03,632 --> 00:05:07,335
Depending on the size of
their force, I don't know how

66
00:05:07,369 --> 00:05:09,370
much time we can buy you.

67
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:12,207
You will do your best, I'm sure.

68
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:14,676
If the team isn't at the
extraction point when you

69
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,681
arrive, you may be forced to
leave them, or put us all at risk.

70
00:05:19,715 --> 00:05:23,051
I'm afraid master gallia is right.

71
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:26,321
They'll be there.

72
00:05:26,355 --> 00:05:30,258
The prisoners have evaded us long enough.

73
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:32,060
Bring out the anoobas!

74
00:05:32,094 --> 00:05:34,062
Use them for tracking only!

75
00:05:48,577 --> 00:05:52,480
Contact me as soon as the
fugitives have been located.

76
00:05:52,515 --> 00:05:55,350
Roger, Roger.

77
00:06:06,462 --> 00:06:10,098
What if your jedi friends
are not there when we arrive?

78
00:06:10,132 --> 00:06:17,372
Keep moving and you won't have
to worry about that, Tarkin.

79
00:06:17,406 --> 00:06:21,309
Why did master Piell have to
share half the intel with that guy?

80
00:06:21,343 --> 00:06:23,978
It's like he's not even
grateful we rescued him.

81
00:06:24,013 --> 00:06:27,582
Captain Tarkin feels the jedi
should be relieved from the

82
00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:29,184
burden of leading the war effort.

83
00:06:29,218 --> 00:06:30,919
That's ridiculous.

84
00:06:30,953 --> 00:06:33,321
Maybe, but we aren't soldiers.

85
00:06:33,355 --> 00:06:34,889
We're peacekeepers.

86
00:06:34,924 --> 00:06:38,826
The jedi code often prevents us from
going far enough to achieve victory.

87
00:06:38,861 --> 00:06:41,396
A rather simple point of view.

88
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,066
Either way, he is a good captain.

89
00:06:47,036 --> 00:06:48,269
Did you hear that?

90
00:06:48,304 --> 00:06:49,871
Yes.

91
00:06:49,905 --> 00:06:52,140
We're going to have company.

92
00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:13,574
Commander, the additional
reinforcements have arrived.

93
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:16,110
Tighten your grip, K2-B4.

94
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:18,746
The Republic will almost
certainly attempt a second

95
00:07:18,781 --> 00:07:23,718
mission to infiltrate our
defenses and rescue the prisoners.

96
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:30,124
I'm counting on you to ensure that
nothing slips past our blockade.

97
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:40,568
You know it's not wise to
argue with master Piell.

98
00:07:40,602 --> 00:07:42,603
It's certainly not a good career move.

99
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:47,308
General Skywalker, I stand by
my principles, no matter what.

100
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,445
Besides, I needn't worry about my career.

101
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,182
I've fallen into favor
with the chancellor.

102
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:55,616
He shall support me.

103
00:07:55,651 --> 00:07:59,420
Oh, I happen to know the
chancellor quite well, myself.

104
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:01,989
Oh, really?

105
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,291
Really.

106
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:04,725
Let's keep moving.

107
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,128
If we're not at the
rendezvous at the exact time,

108
00:08:07,162 --> 00:08:09,130
we'll miss our window.

109
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,002
Those creatures are gaining.

110
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:18,973
If they've caught our scent,
they'll lead the droids right to us.

111
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:20,908
We're gonna have to deal with them.

112
00:08:20,943 --> 00:08:23,778
What about using this
cave to surprise them?

113
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:26,581
If we can get them to pass
by, we can attack them from

114
00:08:26,615 --> 00:08:29,450
behind, but we need a distraction.

115
00:08:29,485 --> 00:08:30,852
Leave that to me.

116
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:34,322
And Obi-Wan, of course.

117
00:08:34,356 --> 00:08:38,126
Okay, the rest of you, follow me.

118
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:56,938
Keep going!

119
00:09:56,972 --> 00:10:00,474
Ahsoka and I will take care of the droids.

120
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:24,659
Master Piell!

121
00:11:39,975 --> 00:11:41,275
I have to get help.

122
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,410
No.

123
00:11:42,444 --> 00:11:44,612
Don't leave.

124
00:11:44,646 --> 00:11:46,681
Listen to me carefully, child.

125
00:11:46,715 --> 00:11:52,953
The information, I need you to
deliver it back to the Council.

126
00:11:52,988 --> 00:11:55,189
I should find Anakin or Obi-Wan.

127
00:11:55,223 --> 00:11:56,891
They need to hear this.

128
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,626
No.

129
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,494
You must listen.

130
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:02,730
But I wasn't assigned to the team.

131
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,566
I lied just so I could
be a part of the mission.

132
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,636
Whether you were meant to
be on this mission or not,

133
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:13,107
you are now the most important part of it.

134
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:17,378
Remember this, and see to it that the

135
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:22,283
information I'm about to give
you is revealed to no one but

136
00:12:22,317 --> 00:12:25,319
the jedi Council.

137
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:30,191
Sir!

138
00:12:30,225 --> 00:12:33,928
The anoobas have located the
fugitives along the northern shore.

139
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,730
Squad, come with me!

140
00:12:35,764 --> 00:12:39,300
I will deal with this personally.

141
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,475
So much for the hunting party.

142
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:51,612
There are more squads on their way.

143
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,614
Oh, no.

144
00:13:13,034 --> 00:13:16,003
He died honorably.

145
00:13:16,037 --> 00:13:18,105
What about the information?

146
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,273
I have it.

147
00:13:19,307 --> 00:13:21,842
He told me just before he died.

148
00:13:29,484 --> 00:13:31,252
We don't have much time.

149
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:35,923
Let's take this moment to
honor him, then we must move on.

150
00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:40,828
He would have wanted us
to complete our mission.

151
00:14:40,783 --> 00:14:47,155
There have not been battles like these
since the days of the old Republic.

152
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:48,489
Indeed.

153
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:50,491
Good hunting.

154
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:26,327
There's the extraction point.

155
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:49,517
Incoming!

156
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:56,791
Look what I found.

157
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:20,181
They are too many droid fighters.

158
00:16:20,215 --> 00:16:24,151
We need more time to
break through the blockade.

159
00:16:24,186 --> 00:16:26,020
We're out of time, master Tiin.

160
00:16:26,054 --> 00:16:27,822
We must break through now.

161
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:28,823
Very well.

162
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:30,625
Wing commanders, form up.

163
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:32,627
We're going in.

164
00:17:20,342 --> 00:17:21,976
Captain!

165
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:27,348
If I can't have the information,
it will die with you.

166
00:17:35,891 --> 00:17:38,693
My thanks, padawan Tano.

167
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:43,598
I see you've trained her well.

168
00:17:43,632 --> 00:17:45,566
The rescue ship should be here by now.

169
00:17:45,601 --> 00:17:48,603
So should the rest of the separatist army.

170
00:17:55,377 --> 00:17:58,579
I believe you've worn out your welcome.

171
00:18:22,638 --> 00:18:25,039
Admiral coburn, we have the survivors.

172
00:18:25,073 --> 00:18:26,674
Recall all fighters.

173
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,675
Yes, general.

174
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:30,978
Prepare to jump to lightspeed.

175
00:19:22,597 --> 00:19:24,732
We're all ready, admiral.

176
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:39,146
Of master Piell's loss,
we are sorry to hear.

177
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:41,148
He will be missed.

178
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:44,251
Because of his great
sacrifice, we now have the

179
00:19:44,286 --> 00:19:46,320
nexus route coordinates.

180
00:19:46,354 --> 00:19:50,357
Captain Tarkin and Ahsoka
have each memorized half.

181
00:19:50,392 --> 00:19:52,593
Debrief them both, we must.

182
00:19:52,627 --> 00:19:56,063
With all due respect, master
jedi, I was instructed by

183
00:19:56,098 --> 00:20:00,267
chancellor Palpatine to bring the
intel directly to him for debriefing.

184
00:20:00,302 --> 00:20:03,070
I promised master Piell that
I would deliver it only to

185
00:20:03,105 --> 00:20:07,408
the Council, and that's what I will do.

186
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:08,542
Hmm.

187
00:20:08,577 --> 00:20:10,911
Personally meet with
the chancellor, I will.

188
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:16,050
Decide what is best to do, we shall.

189
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:18,586
Master Plo, there's
something we want to ask you.

190
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,389
Did you assign ahsoka to the mission?

191
00:20:26,094 --> 00:20:29,163
It appears I did.

192
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:39,273
A job well done, general Skywalker.

193
00:20:42,644 --> 00:20:46,413
I wish more jedi had your
military sensibilities.

194
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,621
Perhaps I can inform the
chancellor of your valor.

195
00:20:53,655 --> 00:20:56,924
I'm not sure what to
think of your new ally.

196
00:20:56,958 --> 00:21:00,094
Well, I think we need people like him.

197
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:01,796
This is a war.

198
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,898
If we aren't willing to
do what it takes to win,

199
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:07,468
we risk losing everything
we try to protect.

200
00:21:07,502 --> 00:21:11,372
Unfortunately, war tends to
distort our point of view.

201
00:21:11,406 --> 00:21:16,143
If we sacrifice our code,
even for victory, we may lose

202
00:21:16,178 --> 00:21:18,679
that which is most important:

203
00:21:18,713 --> 00:21:20,681
Our honor.
