And mistake.

175
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,616
On their part, Ahsoka.

176
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:28,525
You're energy, you're ... .

177
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:31,099
It's what we've been blackin.

178
00:14:31,224 --> 00:14:34,353
... begining to loose hope
and forgot who we are.

179
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:37,646
And who are you?

180
00:14:39,204 --> 00:14:40,424
We are Jedi.

181
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:44,342
All right, we need a strategy.

182
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:46,896
So, what do you suggest?

183
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:48,305
What about a base.

184
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,142
They must have a ...
or something, right?

185
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:52,541
Not .... ever seen.

186
00:14:53,253 --> 00:14:54,915
So where do they come from?

187
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,284
Well, we don't know.

188
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,334
................

189
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:02,836
If we're going to go to the offensive,
we need to find out where they live.

190
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:05,056
We'll start covering ground tomorow.

191
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:53,489
We already covered the beach area.

192
00:15:53,614 --> 00:15:56,101
And most of the brayer
on this side of the baie.

193
00:15:57,585 --> 00:16:00,717
If it's was easy to find,
you guys will find it before I got here.

194
00:16:02,034 --> 00:16:02,926
Truenought.

195
00:16:03,205 --> 00:16:04,938
Maybe we should try more in land.

196
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:06,316
That's where they shot.

197
00:16:06,874 --> 00:16:10,867
Guys, I think we're looking
in the wrong place.

198
00:16:11,566 --> 00:16:13,117
That's their fortress.

199
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,556
Split up!

200
00:16:45,324 --> 00:16:46,516
O-Mer this way.

201
00:17:04,765 --> 00:17:05,796
Kalifa!

202
00:17:10,644 --> 00:17:12,670
Finish her, my son.

203
00:17:13,177 --> 00:17:14,651
Kill is yours.

204
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:17,396
I will kill her,
with my own hands.

205
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:37,236
Come here you jedi ... .

206
00:17:48,489 --> 00:17:50,871
Not so impressive, are you?

207
00:17:51,124 --> 00:17:55,431
And you'll have be the honor
of being my first Jedi Kill.

208
00:17:56,595 --> 00:17:58,601
Firts of many, I hope.

209
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:50,877
Carefull.

210
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:52,306
It's okay.

211
00:18:52,853 --> 00:18:53,917
I can make it.

212
00:18:55,924 --> 00:18:56,760
Kalifa!

213
00:18:58,124 --> 00:19:01,560
Those jedi ... kill my son.

214
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:04,195
...

215
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:09,487
<i>There's no escape.</i>

216
00:19:09,612 --> 00:19:11,879
<i>I'll hunt you down!</i>

217
00:19:14,324 --> 00:19:15,781
Move us in closer!

218
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:18,796
Can't. ... too ... .

219
00:19:18,964 --> 00:19:20,636
Kalifa, we have to move.

220
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:21,516
Hury.

221
00:19:22,298 --> 00:19:23,291
Please.

222
00:19:23,778 --> 00:19:25,561
Ahsoka, leave me.

223
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:28,676
- I wont.
- You have to.

224
00:19:30,976 --> 00:19:33,722
Ahsoka, please take care of....

225
00:19:34,684 --> 00:19:36,601
I'll take care of the others.

226
00:19:37,614 --> 00:19:38,769
I know you will.

227
00:19:56,084 --> 00:19:57,482
I'll kill you!

228
00:19:57,607 --> 00:19:59,509
You kill my son!

229
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:02,310
<i>I'll kill you!</i>

230
00:20:05,444 --> 00:20:06,962
<i>Get hunt for free.</i>

231
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:15,768
What is Ahsoka streight.

232
00:20:17,065 --> 00:20:18,626
She is furless.

233
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,998
That can also be a weakness.

234
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:24,556
Is she ... the aprentis.

235
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:27,923
No one has her kind of determination.

236
00:20:29,524 --> 00:20:30,882
Except you.

237
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:33,065
I'll find her.

238
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:37,058
This may not be with in your power.

239
00:20:38,396 --> 00:20:40,940
What ever you're trying
to say master Plo, just say it!

240
00:20:43,216 --> 00:20:45,669
I am suggesting, that perhaps,

241
00:20:45,882 --> 00:20:47,899
if you have train her well,

242
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:50,017
she is ... take care of herself.

243
00:20:51,152 --> 00:20:52,997
And find a way back,

244
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:54,621
to you.
