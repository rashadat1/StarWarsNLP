1
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,476
<i>Pantora in peril!</i>

2
00:00:18,808 --> 00:00:21,751
<i>The newly elected chairman of
Pantora, Baron Papanoida,</i>

3
00:00:21,784 --> 00:00:24,535
<i>Is caught in a deadly political game.</i>

4
00:00:24,568 --> 00:00:27,108
<i>The Trade Federation
has blockaded Pantora</i>

5
00:00:27,108 --> 00:00:29,592
<i>and suspended all
commerce with the system.</i>

6
00:00:29,624 --> 00:00:31,671
<i>Isolated from the rest of the Republic,</i>

7
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:34,423
<i>The people of Pantora are beginning
to rally against the senate,</i>

8
00:00:34,456 --> 00:00:37,016
<i>Who have seemed unsympathetic to their plight.</i>

9
00:00:37,048 --> 00:00:38,328
<i>To make matters worse,</i>

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,104
<i>Count Dooku has come forward
offering aid if Pantora joins</i>

11
00:00:42,136 --> 00:00:43,832
<i>the separatist alliance.</i>

12
00:00:43,864 --> 00:00:46,923
<i>Chairman Papanoida has dispatched
senator Chuchi to Coruscant</i>

13
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:50,200
<i>with the hope that she can motivate
the senate to act in favor of Pantora</i>

14
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:53,880
<i>Before Lott Dod can legitimize the blockade.</i>

15
00:00:53,913 --> 00:00:57,176
The Trade Federation is neutral in this,

16
00:00:57,209 --> 00:00:59,736
but Pantora must pay its debt

17
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:03,320
before we can resume commerce
with the system.

18
00:01:03,353 --> 00:01:04,472
That is a lie.

19
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:08,056
It is well known that the Trade Federation
is aligned with the Separatists.

20
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,035
Slanderous.

21
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,970
We are not separatists simply
because we do business with them.

22
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:15,288
How many times must I remind you

23
00:01:15,322 --> 00:01:18,841
of the commerce treaty of 1647?

24
00:01:18,873 --> 00:01:22,041
The Trade Federation is neutral.

25
00:01:22,074 --> 00:01:24,345
I beg the senate to listen to our pleas.

26
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:29,259
Ignore the Trade Federation's feeble attempt
to paint this as a domestic financial issue

27
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,905
and allow us to resume trade.

28
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:44,858
Wait.

29
00:01:44,923 --> 00:01:46,090
Senator Chuchi.

30
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:49,050
I wanted to compliment you on
your speech.

31
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:50,234
Thank you, padme.

32
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:51,865
You are very brave.

33
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,946
The Trade Federation
doesn't frighten me.

34
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,370
I just wanted to let you know

35
00:01:55,403 --> 00:01:57,196
that there are many of
us in the Senate that

36
00:01:57,275 --> 00:01:59,738
support you and Pantora
in these difficult times.

37
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:02,362
I know the separatists have
approached you to offer their help.

38
00:02:02,395 --> 00:02:04,026
Please do not take it.

39
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:07,226
The senate will force the Trade
Federation to resume trade.

40
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,410
Don't worry, senator.

41
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:09,658
There's no way that Pantora will

44
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:16,699
The chairman of Pantora's just arrived.
I must go brief him.

45
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:21,051
Please, send him my best wishes.

46
00:02:21,084 --> 00:02:22,555
Chairman Papanoida.

47
00:02:22,587 --> 00:02:23,611
Senator Chuchi,

48
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,331
you spoke well on behalf of our
people today.

49
00:02:26,364 --> 00:02:29,019
I only hope the senate is truly listening.

50
00:02:29,052 --> 00:02:30,523
As do I, chairman.

51
00:02:30,556 --> 00:02:32,667
Allow me to introduce my family.

52
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,563
These are my daughters,

53
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:35,291
Chi Eekway and Che Amanwe,

54
00:02:35,324 --> 00:02:37,563
And my son, Ion.

55
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:39,292
Father, Amanwe and I
are going home.

56
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:40,860
Don't be too late.

57
00:02:40,892 --> 00:02:41,691
I won't be long.

58
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:42,843
Ion and I have some issues to

59
00:02:42,877 --> 00:02:47,388
discuss with the senator first.

60
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:50,075
Things are deteriorating rapidly, senator.

61
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:51,324
Ion has just brought word from

62
00:02:51,357 --> 00:02:52,443
Pantora that things are far

63
00:02:52,477 --> 00:02:54,556
worse than we've been led to believe.

64
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:55,900
The people are restless.

65
00:02:55,932 --> 00:02:59,900
The Trade Federation blockade is causing far
more damage and disorder than we predicted.

66
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:01,148
We need more time.

67
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,420
The senate will vote in our favor,
I'm sure of it.

68
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:05,180
Count Dooku and the
Separatists are promising

69
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:08,188
immediate aid and a resolution
to the blockade.

70
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,429
You're not suggesting we
join them, are you?

71
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:11,708
Certainly not.

72
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:13,020
I merely point out that the

73
00:03:13,054 --> 00:03:16,189
wheels of democracy are
moving too slowly.

74
00:03:16,222 --> 00:03:17,533
There are Pantorans rallying

75
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:18,780
for us to leave the Republic

76
00:03:18,814 --> 00:03:20,317
And join the separatists.

77
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:22,429
We cannot give up on the
Republic senate.

78
00:03:22,461 --> 00:03:23,837
Chairman, you must convince the

79
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,461
people to remain loyal to our cause.

80
00:03:26,494 --> 00:03:29,661
I will do what I can, Senator.

81
00:03:36,574 --> 00:03:38,653
What's wrong with the lights?

82
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:40,190
Did you see that?

83
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:41,150
It's nothing.

84
00:03:41,182 --> 00:03:43,166
Just the shadows playing tricks.

85
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,517
Don't tell me you're afraid of the dark.

86
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,798
Chi?

87
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,182
Chi?

88
00:03:57,214 --> 00:03:59,966
Stop fooling around.

89
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,022
My father's a powerful man.

90
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:06,590
If you hurt me or my sister,

91
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:11,070
You'll be dead.

92
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,502
Big talk.

93
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:17,566
You're coming with us.

94
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:18,206
Smack!

95
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:22,846
Hurry.

96
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,798
Let's go.

97
00:04:34,272 --> 00:04:37,311
I don't like the situation
on Pantora one bit.

98
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,494
It reminds me far too much

99
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,543
of Naboo's own scarred history.

100
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:43,423
Well, that blockade wasn't that bad.

101
00:04:43,456 --> 00:04:45,599
It's the reason I met you,
after all.

102
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:49,247
You certainly have a unique way
of looking at things, Ani.

103
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,463
Senator Amidala.

104
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:51,807
Master skywalker.

105
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,119
What is it, Ahsoka?

106
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:56,223
Someone has kidnapped
Chairman Papanoida's daughters.

107
00:04:56,256 --> 00:04:58,688
I was afraid something like
this would happen.

108
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,648
Anakin?

109
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,248
The jedi can't ket involved.

110
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,232
This is a job for the local police.

111
00:05:03,264 --> 00:05:04,415
I'm not so sure local

112
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:05,983
Authorities can handle it.

113
00:05:06,017 --> 00:05:09,024
The separatists are putting a lot of pressure
on Pantora to join them.

114
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:12,704
I'm afraid this blockade may give the
Pantorans no other choice.

115
00:05:12,737 --> 00:05:17,728
Master, if the jedi can't officially get involved,
let me do this on my own.

116
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:19,936
Senator Chuchi is a good friend
of mine.

117
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:24,288
All right, with the Separatists involved,
I guess it gives you cause to investigate.

118
00:05:24,321 --> 00:05:27,904
Go help senator Chuchi,
but don't get in the way of the local authorities.

119
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:29,344
Aren't you going to help?

120
00:05:29,377 --> 00:05:33,345
I said the situation gives you cause to investigate,
not us.

121
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:35,681
I need to go back to the jedi
temple and make sure the council...

122
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:38,049
doesn't find out about your
little expedition.

123
00:05:38,082 --> 00:05:40,673
Should you really proceed
without the council's approval?

124
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:43,105
We do it all the time,
don't we, Snips?

125
00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:44,161
Yep.

126
00:05:44,194 --> 00:05:46,177
Well, be careful, Ahsoka.

127
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,825
I still can't believe
they let you teach.

128
00:05:49,858 --> 00:05:52,225
Give your father my condolences.

129
00:05:52,258 --> 00:05:54,305
If you want your sisters back,

130
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:57,409
we're here to help.

131
00:05:57,442 --> 00:06:03,425
Father, count Dooku has offered to
help us find Chi Eekway and Che Amanwe.

132
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:07,458
Chuchi, senator Amidala
sent me to help if I can.

133
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:08,866
Chairman Papanoida.

134
00:06:08,898 --> 00:06:10,786
This is my good friend Ahsoka.

135
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:11,522
Good.

136
00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:13,762
A jedi can always be of help.

137
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:17,410
Senator Amidala thinks this may have
something to do with the separatists.

138
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,266
They've already made contact with us.

139
00:06:19,299 --> 00:06:20,866
I don't think this is a kidnapping.

140
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:22,402
I think they're holding them hostage.

141
00:06:22,435 --> 00:06:26,051
A not very subtle attempt to
get us to join the separatists?

142
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,116
If the separatists are involved,
your daughters may be held on

143
00:06:29,117 --> 00:06:31,618
the Trade Federation ship
blockading your planet.

144
00:06:31,651 --> 00:06:34,627
That is a possibility.

145
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:38,787
Why don't you and Chuchi pay them a
diplomatic visit and see what you can find out.

146
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,243
We'll stay here and follow the
police investigation.

147
00:06:47,524 --> 00:06:49,250
Did you find anything?

148
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,099
We've completed a thorough
sweep of your apartment, Chairman.

149
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:53,603
No evidence of foul play.

150
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:56,324
My daughters' lives are in your hands, inspector.

151
00:06:56,356 --> 00:06:58,563
You have nothing to worry about, your honor.

152
00:06:58,597 --> 00:07:01,668
We are in complete control
of the situation.

153
00:07:07,877 --> 00:07:10,756
That inspector is useless.

154
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:12,003
Somewhere.

155
00:07:12,037 --> 00:07:12,803
Look here.

156
00:07:12,837 --> 00:07:14,819
The icon of the moon goddess.

157
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:21,924
It should be up on the shrine
with the others.

158
00:07:21,957 --> 00:07:22,820
Wait a minute.

159
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:24,100
What's this?

160
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:25,732
Blood.

161
00:07:25,765 --> 00:07:28,900
It must be what they used
to fight off their attackers.

162
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:32,484
But the kidnappers didn't know
to put it back in the right place.

163
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:37,764
Information retrieval.

164
00:07:37,798 --> 00:07:41,221
I need you to match this blood sample
against known galactic criminals.

165
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:46,404
A rodian.

166
00:07:46,438 --> 00:07:48,709
It says here his name's Greedo.

167
00:07:48,742 --> 00:07:51,461
Looks like
he's based on Tatooine.

168
00:07:51,494 --> 00:07:53,381
Then what are we waiting for?

169
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,195
Senator Chuchi,

170
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:26,402
to what do we owe this pleasure?

171
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:28,610
I bring word from
the chairman of Pantora.

172
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:32,067
The chairman has finally
decided to agree to our terms?

173
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:33,027
Not exactly.

174
00:08:32,963 --> 00:08:35,699
The chairman wanted to inform
you of an impending alliance

175
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,427
between Pantora and the
Confederacy of Independent Systems.

176
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:43,298
The chairman is planning to
join the separatist alliance?

177
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:46,275
If that were the case,
would you remove your blockade of Pantora?

178
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:49,888
If that were the case, the chairman
would have to go to the senate

179
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:51,331
And renounce the Republic.

180
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,851
Then we could discuss how
quickly we can resume commerce.

181
00:08:54,884 --> 00:08:55,555
Very well.

182
00:08:55,588 --> 00:08:56,867
I shall contact the chairman.

183
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,908
We can discuss the finer details
of the terms later this evening.

184
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,931
Agreed.

185
00:09:00,965 --> 00:09:05,027
Now you and your servant may
stay as our honored guests.

186
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:07,396
Come this way to your rooms.

187
00:09:31,525 --> 00:09:32,932
Be careful, Ion.

188
00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:36,933
The hutts are the only law
that matters on Tatooine.

189
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:39,557
I don't scare easily.

190
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,941
Where do we start?

191
00:10:03,974 --> 00:10:06,598
We'll have to get a feel
for the crowd.

192
00:10:14,054 --> 00:10:16,101
Shouldn't we talk to Jabba directly?

193
00:10:16,135 --> 00:10:16,773
No.

194
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:19,878
Remember, we're not sure who's
behind this kidnapping yet.

195
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,478
Jabba could be involved.

196
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,981
What if Greedo runs?

197
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:24,934
We'll let Greedo know
we're here.

198
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:26,917
That way, he'll come to us.

199
00:10:26,951 --> 00:10:28,326
How are we gonna do that?

200
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:30,566
Follow me.

201
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,150
Ladies,

202
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:41,926
Do any of you know Greedo?

203
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,623
Who's asking?

204
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:45,126
We're asking.

205
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:47,527
We're looking to hire
a bounty hunter.

206
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,966
He's not here.

207
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:50,982
But if he comes back,

208
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:55,462
I'll tell him you were asking for him.

209
00:10:55,496 --> 00:10:56,903
Patience.

210
00:10:56,935 --> 00:10:58,407
If she won't lead us to Greedo,

211
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,159
she'll lead Greedo to us.

212
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:18,823
This is the ambassador's office.

213
00:11:18,856 --> 00:11:21,160
Maybe we'll find something here.

214
00:11:21,192 --> 00:11:24,263
The separatists are still
recovering from their defeat...

215
00:11:24,297 --> 00:11:25,000
They're coming.

216
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:26,920
Hide.

217
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:31,848
We need to know who our supporters are.

218
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:36,037
I understand your profit margins with
the separatists can be considerable,

219
00:11:36,085 --> 00:11:38,024
however, I object to the kidnapping.

220
00:11:39,113 --> 00:11:41,385
The chairman's children are leverage.

221
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:44,200
Besides, they're well taken care of.

222
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:46,377
Yes, but why on my ship?

223
00:11:47,113 --> 00:11:50,377
What was that?

224
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,297
Are you certain we're alone?

225
00:12:02,026 --> 00:12:04,553
I'm sure I heard something.

226
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,737
All of this scheming with the separatists
is making you paranoid.

227
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,697
Do not worry.

228
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,034
The daughters are not to be harmed...

229
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:26,954
at least for now.

230
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:39,434
You see?

231
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,866
The Trade Federation is behind the kidnapping.

232
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:43,658
Let's find the detention area.

233
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:46,378
Come on.

234
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,371
Poodoo!

235
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:59,018
Greedo, baby, there you are.

236
00:12:59,723 --> 00:13:01,931
There's some men here looking for you.

237
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:03,691
Pantorans.

238
00:13:03,724 --> 00:13:05,547
They must have found some evidence.

239
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:08,491
We'll have to settle things
more permanently.

240
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,536
Have you done this before?

241
00:13:18,568 --> 00:13:21,128
No, but I've been practicing.

242
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:24,008
The detention block is closed to visitors.

243
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,576
Move along.

244
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:28,584
You will let me pass.

245
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:30,600
I will let you pass.

246
00:13:34,217 --> 00:13:38,824
I'm sorry, the detention block
is closed to visitors.

247
00:13:38,857 --> 00:13:40,424
Ahsoka.

248
00:13:40,457 --> 00:13:42,824
Ugh.

249
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:45,864
You will let us both pass.

250
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:50,056
I...

251
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:52,393
I will let you both pass.

252
00:14:01,353 --> 00:14:03,753
Looking for someone, Chairman?

253
00:14:03,786 --> 00:14:06,377
I was looking for you, Greedo.

254
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,321
Tell me where my daughters are
or die.

255
00:14:12,426 --> 00:14:14,761
You were a fool to come here.

256
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:16,713
Let's dispose of them outside.

257
00:14:21,547 --> 00:14:24,009
I don't want to die
on this dust ball.

258
00:14:24,042 --> 00:14:25,930
We won't have to.

259
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:29,930
Hey!

260
00:14:35,306 --> 00:14:36,849
We're going to talk to Jabba about this.

261
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,057
This is the fifth area we've checked,

262
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:44,874
and there's no sign of the Chairman's daughter.

263
00:14:44,907 --> 00:14:46,218
Can't you sense where they are?

264
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,106
Isn't that something
you jedi can do?

265
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:50,762
It's not something I can just turn on or off.

266
00:14:50,795 --> 00:14:52,426
We'll just have to keep looking.

267
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:55,466
Sir, we have intruders
in the detention area.

268
00:14:55,499 --> 00:15:00,522
It looks like our guests got a little
too curious for their own good.

269
00:15:08,364 --> 00:15:09,931
Chairman Papanoida,

270
00:15:09,963 --> 00:15:11,370
the mighty Jabba wishes to know

271
00:15:11,404 --> 00:15:14,155
why you tried to kill
one of his bounty hunters.

272
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:18,283
Great Jabba, my daughters
have been kidnapped.

273
00:15:18,316 --> 00:15:19,531
As a father yourself,

274
00:15:19,564 --> 00:15:23,243
I know you understand that I will do
anything to get them back safely.

275
00:15:24,236 --> 00:15:26,757
I have evidence that
Greedo is responsible

276
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:29,219
which means that
either you are behind it

277
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,564
or Greedo is working for someone else.

278
00:15:31,596 --> 00:15:34,059
Since we are friends, Jabba,

279
00:15:34,093 --> 00:15:36,524
I know you would never
do such a thing.

280
00:15:36,557 --> 00:15:37,164
No! No!

281
00:15:37,196 --> 00:15:38,059
He's lying!

282
00:15:40,428 --> 00:15:43,212
We found blood
at the scene of the crime.

283
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:45,356
If it matches Greedo's,

284
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:47,660
It will prove he is the kidnapper.

285
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:54,252
Jabba will allow a blood
sample to be taken.

286
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:55,756
Wait, wait, no!

287
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,972
It's all lies!

288
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:02,764
Okay, okay.

289
00:16:02,798 --> 00:16:04,109
I kidnapped them.

290
00:16:04,141 --> 00:16:07,308
The separatists wanted leverage
against you.

291
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,228
Where are they, you slime?

292
00:16:09,262 --> 00:16:11,052
One of them is here
at Mos Eisley.

293
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:14,797
She's safe, I assure you.

294
00:16:19,726 --> 00:16:22,733
Let's hope she's in this one.

295
00:16:30,446 --> 00:16:31,725
Senator Chuchi,

296
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:34,253
how did you find me?

297
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:35,853
It's a long story.

298
00:16:35,887 --> 00:16:37,133
Where's your sister?

299
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,093
I don't know.

300
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:40,973
We were separated.

301
00:16:51,183 --> 00:16:52,910
All right, Sleemo, no tricks.

302
00:16:52,943 --> 00:16:55,470
We're gonna go inside

303
00:16:55,502 --> 00:16:56,942
Nice and easy.

304
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,598
You think they will just hand
her over to you?

305
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:04,239
No, but I'll bet they'll hand
her over to you.

306
00:17:16,048 --> 00:17:18,831
Go get the prisoner.

307
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,127
Greedo,

308
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,631
what are you doing here?

309
00:17:23,664 --> 00:17:26,287
There's been a change of plans.

310
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,559
We're going to have to
move the prisoner.

311
00:17:28,592 --> 00:17:33,423
On whose orders?

312
00:17:33,456 --> 00:17:34,447
Gunray.

313
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,687
He contacted me at Jabba's palace.

314
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,999
Why'd he contact you?

315
00:17:38,032 --> 00:17:42,095
And who are those two?

316
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:45,775
They're emissaries of the Trade Federation.

317
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:47,247
Trade federation?

318
00:17:47,281 --> 00:17:49,744
They don't look like
Trade Federation to me.

319
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:51,856
Father!

320
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:53,200
Father?

321
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:54,480
They're Pantorans!

322
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:55,184
Blast them!

323
00:18:38,354 --> 00:18:39,986
Stop them!

324
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,105
Smash!

325
00:18:53,746 --> 00:18:55,665
Surrender, separatist!

326
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:06,418
What is the meaning of this?

327
00:19:06,451 --> 00:19:09,618
You've been holding the Chairman of
Pantora's daughter as a hostage.

328
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:10,290
What?

329
00:19:10,323 --> 00:19:12,466
Sib Cannay, what is she talking about?

330
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:14,803
I want my litigator.

331
00:19:14,835 --> 00:19:16,051
We are businessmen!

332
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,098
We deal in trade and commerce!

333
00:19:18,132 --> 00:19:21,682
Yes, but perhaps your
business is war profiteering.

334
00:19:21,716 --> 00:19:23,283
How dare you!

335
00:19:23,315 --> 00:19:25,856
I dare because you claim
to have no involvement,

336
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:28,915
and yet here stands the
chairman's daughter on your ship,

337
00:19:28,948 --> 00:19:31,091
held by your administrator.

338
00:19:31,124 --> 00:19:33,843
I may understand your position,

339
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:36,019
but I doubt the rest of the
Senate will.

340
00:19:36,052 --> 00:19:37,299
Blackmail.

341
00:19:37,332 --> 00:19:39,059
No, business.

342
00:19:39,092 --> 00:19:43,571
I could, of course, be persuaded to defend
your unfortunate circumstances to the senate,

343
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:46,995
That is, if this blockade ended.

344
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:50,708
I'll see what I can do.

345
00:19:55,157 --> 00:20:00,089
It has come to our attention that
the ugly head of the Separatist

346
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:05,844
has once again raised itself in the
ranks of our very own Trade Federation.

347
00:20:05,877 --> 00:20:11,252
Nute Gunray's influence extends farther
than we ever imagined.

348
00:20:11,285 --> 00:20:14,579
It was Sib Cannay
acting on his own accord

349
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,484
who kidnapped the children
of chairman Papanoida.

350
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:19,765
In good faith,

351
00:20:19,797 --> 00:20:21,716
we have returned them to him.

352
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,788
And also as a gesture of friendship,

353
00:20:24,822 --> 00:20:26,889
we are removing our blockade

354
00:20:27,158 --> 00:20:30,389
and reopening trade
with the Pantorans.
