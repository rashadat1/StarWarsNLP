00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:29,342

in a fortress known as The Citadel.

Leading an elite strike team,
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin

Piell and his officers.

Now the jedi have split up to

This passage will get
us near the landing pad.

Artoo, send the shuttle to
the rear landing platform.

The trick will be if
Anakin arrives on time.

Looks like we've got some cutting to do.

Count dooku insists that you
speak with him, commander.

Count dooku, my lord, how unexpected.

You may cease the
propriety, commander Sobeck.

I understand there is a
problem with the jedi prisoner.

An incursion team attempted
a rescue, but the situation is

taken care of.

37

Are you in possession of
the information the prisoner

is carrying?

39

Not yet, but we will soon have it.

You are aware that this
information will tip the scale

of the war to the side that controls it.

42

Perhaps this is a matter
that requires my presence.

No, my lord.

Find them, commander.

Get the information.

46

Then kill them all.

47

Don't ever surprise me with a
transmission from count dooku.

48

I need time to prepare!

Yes, commander.

50
00:04:34,354 --> 00:04:37,590
I am beginning to admire
the design of this fortress.

It's raer formidable to evade.

How can you admire
such a horrible place?

Ah, you reveal your shortsightedness.

how effective facilities like

All right, snips, I need
you to lead the group.

59

Keep following the tunnel.

I'll catch up.

Hey, where are you going?

62
00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:10,423
Obi-Wan's not here, so someone
has to protect our flank.

63
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:13,859
I guess it's a good thing
I came along after all.

64
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,635
We've received a coded transmission.

65
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:25,471
Apparently, they've
split up into two groups.

66
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:26,772
The rendezvous points are the

67

landing field behind the tower,

68
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:32,111
where artoo will pick
up Obi-Wan Kenobi,

69
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:36,616
and the pipeline exit, where
they'll find Anakin Skywalker.

70
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,619
And what if things don't
go according to plan?

71
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:40,987
Then we would have to send

an entire fleet to
get them out of there.

have elected this
child to lead the group.

166
00:13:23,187 --> 00:13:24,020
Not to worry.

167
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,022
He'll switch to plan "b."

168
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,675
How much longer are we
going to wander through this

169
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:47,243
tunnel in the dark?

170
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:50,179
Captain tarkin, haven't you
learned to trust me by now?

171
00:13:50,214 --> 00:13:51,681
You may have earned my trust,

172
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:53,483
general Skywalker, but my faith

173
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:55,952
in your comrades is still lacking.

174
00:13:55,986 --> 00:13:58,454
You lack faith in the jedi.

175
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:00,923
I find their tactics ineffective.

176
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,459
The jedi code prevents them
from going far enough to

177
00:14:03,494 --> 00:14:06,596
achieve victory, to do
whatever it takes to win,

178
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,864
the very reason why

179
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:12,068
peacekeepers should
not be leading a war.

180
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,270
Have I offended you?

181
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:15,571
No.

182
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,908
I've also found that we
sometimes fall short of victory

183
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,543
because of our methods.

184
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:24,313
Well, I see we agree on something.

185
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:31,921
I think I found a way out.

186
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,763
What do you see, snips?

187
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:42,665
The coast is clear.

188
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:44,667
Any sign of Obi-Wan and the shuttle?

189
00:14:44,701 --> 00:14:48,638
No, I don't see him or artoo anywhere.

190
00:14:56,246 --> 00:14:58,781
We've got to go.

191
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:01,350
There could be a whole
battalion of droids out there.

192
00:15:01,385 --> 00:15:04,320
Better than hiding in a fuel line.

193
00:15:07,758 --> 00:15:09,892
[Lightsabers humming]

194
00:15:09,927 --> 00:15:13,396
[Blasters firing]

195
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:27,043
The plan's been compromised.

196
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:28,911
The shuttle's not coming.

197
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:30,913
Throw me a charge.

198
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:40,122
[Loud explosion]

199
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:48,865
Let's go.

200
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:50,199
Time for plan "b."

201
00:15:50,234 --> 00:15:51,968
There's a plan "b"?

202
00:15:52,002 --> 00:15:53,903
There's always a backup plan.

203
00:15:53,937 --> 00:15:56,739
We'll meet artoo at Obi-Wan's position.

204
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,845
Based on their recent
position, we believe they're

205
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,650
traveling along this cave system.

206
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:09,752
Uh, sir, the prisoners

207
00:16:09,786 --> 00:16:12,188
did not make it to the
interrogation level.

208
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:16,526
What...Did...You... Just...Say?

209
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,262
Um, we think they might
have gone to the...

210
00:16:19,296 --> 00:16:23,833
Sir, count dooku commands you
to contact him immediately.

211
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:33,476
Inform count dooku
that I am unreachable.

212
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,679
Send all units to the airfield.

213
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:41,384
It's their only possible way of escape.

214
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,693
Hold it.

215
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:53,095
Where are you going
with these prisoners?

216
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,031
We're transferring
them aboard the shuttle

217
00:16:55,065 --> 00:16:56,699
from Citadel to Point Tarron.

218
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:58,200
Point Tarron?

219
00:16:58,235 --> 00:17:01,170
There's no outpost there.

220
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:02,838
Uh, it's new.

221
00:17:02,873 --> 00:17:04,974
[R2-d2 beeps]

222
00:17:05,008 --> 00:17:06,108
We have orders.

223
00:17:06,143 --> 00:17:08,110
We're coming aboard.

224
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:14,717
Wait.!

225
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:19,121
The prisoners are escaping
with reprogrammed battle droids.

226
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:22,291
Let no one on board that shuttle.

227
00:17:22,326 --> 00:17:23,259
[Lightsaber hums]

228
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:26,262
[Blasters firing]

229
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:52,855
Sorry I'm late.

230
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:54,857
How nice of you to join us.

231
00:17:58,629 --> 00:18:00,296
The ship is surrounded.

232
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,765
We need to launch a full forward assault

233
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,133
and take that vessel.

234
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,735
We may have a bigger problem:

235
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:06,702
Those turrets.

236
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:09,138
If we don't take them out, they
will use them to destroy the

237
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:11,173
shuttle and prevent our escape.

238
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,709
Which is precisely why we
should get aboard that shuttle

239
00:18:13,744 --> 00:18:17,179
and use the weapon systems
to decimate those droids.

240
00:18:17,214 --> 00:18:20,816
Whatever we're gonna
do, we better do it fast.

241
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,298
[R2-d2 beeps]

242
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,389
General Skywalker, a droid is
Manning one of those turrets.

243
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:36,125
They're gonna blow up the shuttle, sir.

244
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:52,108
This is our only chance.

245
00:19:52,142 --> 00:19:54,110
We've got to stop him.

246
00:19:58,682 --> 00:20:00,916
Echo, look out!

247
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,594
Echo!

248
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,596
We have to go now.

249
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,973
[Alarm beeping]

250
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,578
Master Kenobi, what has happened?

251
00:20:29,613 --> 00:20:33,983
I'm afraid we've had a
situation with the shuttle.

252
00:20:34,017 --> 00:20:37,153
By "situation," he
means "big explosion."

253
00:20:37,187 --> 00:20:38,654
We're gonna need a rescue.

254
00:20:38,688 --> 00:20:39,922
It will be done.

255
00:20:39,956 --> 00:20:41,924
I'm sending our cruisers now.

256
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:03,078
We'll need to hold out until
the council sends a ship.

257
00:21:03,113 --> 00:21:04,313
Not a problem.

258
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:05,981
We've beat them once.

259
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:08,684
We'll beat them again.

260
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:13,022
This landscape is almost
impossible to cross.

261
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:15,391
How are we going to get
to the rendezvous point?

262
00:21:15,425 --> 00:21:18,327
That is the trap of The Citadel.

263
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:19,528
It was designed so it would be

264
00:21:19,563 --> 00:21:22,531
almost impossible for fugitives
to get off the surface,

265
00:21:22,566 --> 00:21:24,667
even if they escaped the tower.

266
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,670
Oh, lucky we're not just any fugitives.

267
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:30,072
I hope you're right.
