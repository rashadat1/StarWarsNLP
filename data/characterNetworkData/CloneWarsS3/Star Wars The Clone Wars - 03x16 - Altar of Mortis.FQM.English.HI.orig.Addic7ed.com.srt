[171][189]??
[191][222]Sent to discover the origin|of a mysterious distress call.
[223][262]Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker,|and his padawan, ahsoka tano.
[262][284]All stranded on a distant planet.
[286][307]Later they discover three beings,
[308][352]more powerful with the force|than any jedi have seen before.
[353][379]The father keeps a fragile|balance between his daughter,
[380][412]who allies with the light side,|and the son, who drifts ever
[413][435]closer to the dark.
[435][467]With his strength failing, the|father asks Anakin to stay and
[468][513]take his place, preserving the|balance between light and dark,
[513][556]but after passing a perilous|test, Skywalker refuses.
[557][582]Now, we find our heroes about|to depart for their journey
[582][616]home...|Or so they think.
[756][777]Anakin.
[777][795]Anakin.
[796][809]Anakin.
[809][829][Gasps]
[945][975]It's true what they say.
[976][1010]You are the chosen one.
[1011][1031]Join me.
[1031][1108]Together we can change the balance|of the universe, my friend.
[1109][1150]You must know I will never|join the dark side willingly.
[1150][1199]How simple you make it, light|and dark, as if there is
[1200][1236]one without the other.
[1236][1293]Aligned, you and I can restore|balance wherever we go,
[1294][1320]peace to the universe.
[1320][1341]By becoming a sith.
[1341][1362]Never.
[1362][1422]We will destroy the sith and the jedi.
[1446][1469][Roaring]
[1489][1521][Gasps]
[1521][1545]Were you having a nightmare?
[1546][1570]Something like that.
[1571][1604]If you're done napping, I|could use a little help here.
[1605][1615]I'm coming.
[1615][1622][Gasps]
[1622][1665][Groaning]
[1665][1688]Leaving so soon?
[1689][1708]Not without this, you won't.
[1734][1751]Ahsoka!
[1752][1774][Screaming]
[1792][1802]What's going on?
[1803][1817]The son took ahsoka.
[1817][1837]What in the blazes are|you talking about?
[1837][1844]Move.
[1844][1867]Let me fly.
[1946][1953][Screams]
[1954][1975][Snarling]
[2305][2325]Look out!
[2463][2493][Electricity crackling]
[2520][2535]I didn't think you saw it.
[2536][2553]It was a giant tower.
[2553][2573]Of course I saw it.
[2636][2656]Any sign of him?
[2656][2669]No.
[2669][2703]But I think it's obvious|where he's taken her.
[2741][2753]We must hurry.
[2754][2778]Anakin, this wasn't a mistake.
[2778][2795]He brought us here for a reason.
[2795][2812]We must not get involved.
[2813][2838]Any conflict here could have|dramatic repercussions for the
[2838][2851]universe at large.
[2851][2860]I don't care.
[2861][2878]He's too powerful for ahsoka.
[2878][2893]I won't leave her alone.
[2893][2929]We are in the middle of something|we don't truly understand.
[2929][2954]We'd be wise to confer|with the father first.
[2954][2967]There's no time.
[2967][2995]This is what he wants, to divide us.
[2995][3017]It's my fault he took her.
[3017][3040]You must feel how strong this|part of the planet is with the
[3040][3056]dark side.
[3056][3080]The father will know what to do.
[3080][3100]He can't help us.
[3163][3189]You cannot keep me here.
[3190][3200]You hear me?
[3200][3222]Save your energy.
[3223][3258]You have been left to die.
[3258][3279]Then I will escape.
[3279][3293]Impossible.
[3293][3305][Chuckles]
[3305][3347]I have been here for more years|than I care to remember.
[3348][3366]I am a jedi.
[3367][3385]We don't give up easily.
[3386][3401]Jedi?
[3401][3414]Huh.
[3414][3436]But so young.
[3436][3477]Where is your master?
[3477][3499]He will come for me.
[3499][3531]And if he does not?
[3531][3549]He will.
[3549][3588]What makes you so sure?
[3589][3618][Mechanical whirring]
[3618][3632]Thank you.
[3632][3650]The chains?
[3650][3679]The chains are the easy part.
[3679][3725]It's what goes on in here that's hard.
[3725][3743]Don't you see, child?
[3743][3778]You are alone now.
[3779][3848]If you are to survive, you|must forget your master.
[3848][3892]I don't think I...|Ow!
[3892][3908]What have you done?
[3909][3953]You are mine now.
[3953][3974][Gasps]
[4154][4172]Anakin.
[4172][4197]Always on the move.
[4197][4225]How do I even find the father?
[4390][4430]You are growing stronger, my son.
[4430][4452]Am I, father?
[4452][4492]Vanity, however, is getting|the better of you.
[4492][4509]How so?
[4509][4542]You have done what is forbidden.
[4569][4604]You've chosen the dark side and|allowed it to feed your anger
[4604][4623]and desire for power.
[4623][4663]By bringing the chosen one here,|you've shown me my potential.
[4663][4683]You've only yourself to blame.
[4683][4702]Do not do this, son.
[4703][4726]Do not become what you should not.
[4726][4764]Be strong, I implore you,|or else I will be forced
[4765][4783]to contain you.
[4783][4810]You look frail, father.
[4811][4851]I am not dead yet.
[4852][4909]Well, perhaps I am tired of waiting.
[4909][4940]I hate you!
[5008][5041]Father!
[5275][5292]We will leave him to rest.
[5292][5306]I must talk to him.
[5306][5327]Not until he's stronger.
[5327][5356]But your brother is losing|himself to the dark side.
[5356][5371]He's taken our friend.
[5372][5395]Then he must have his reasons.
[5395][5428]The same reason he had for|attempting to murder your father?
[5428][5444]He would never do such a thing.
[5444][5460]But I saw him.
[5460][5478]It is not his fault.
[5479][5512]My nature is to do what is|selfless, but my brother's will
[5513][5533]always be to do what is selfish.
[5533][5559]Then know you must help us.
[5560][5592]I cannot interfere with|the ways of the force.
[5592][5622]My father forbids it.
[5623][5646]Your brother will flee this|place and wreak havoc on the
[5646][5658]universe.
[5658][5695]You and Anakin combined|have the power to stop him.
[5712][5748]Come with me.
[5748][5778][Thunder booming]
[6186][6209]I can go no further.
[6209][6239]When you reach the altar, it|will give you what you need.
[6240][6270]I-I don't understand.
[6270][6314]He who wields the blade will|be able to control my brother.
[6603][6633][Thunder booming]
[6677][6695][Grunts]
[6695][6715][Panting]
[6839][6868]Ahsoka.
[6869][6889]Ahsoka, it's me.
[6890][6898]You're safe now.
[6898][6913]Let's go.
[6914][6953]Are you proud of me, master?
[6954][6973]What?
[6973][6993]Uh, of course, snips.
[6993][7003]Course I'm proud of you.
[7003][7030]Now, let's get out of here.
[7031][7068]He's right, right about everything.
[7069][7090]You must join him.
[7091][7125]He only wants what's|best for the universe.
[7126][7147]Hey, what's wrong with you?
[7148][7180]Always with the criticism, master.
[7181][7229]Never really believing|in me, trusting me.
[7230][7260]Well, I don't need you anymore.
[7261][7273]Ahsoka.
[7273][7292]Ahsoka, listen to me.
[7293][7305]He has done something to you.
[7305][7317]Snap out of it.
[7317][7331]This isn't you, ahsoka.
[7331][7347]Isn't it?
[7347][7380]I feel more like myself|than I ever have.
[7381][7407]He asked me to give you a message.
[7408][7452]He said if you don't join|him, he will kill me.
[7453][7465][Laughs]
[7466][7480]I won't let him.
[7480][7518]Then you will be forced to kill me.
[7773][7793]Sister.
[7793][7818]What a pleasant surprise.
[7818][7838]And you brought a friend.
[7839][7855]What have you done, brother?
[7855][7878]Done?
[7878][7932]I have done what is right...|Or what is wrong, depending on
[7933][7948]your point of view.
[7948][7968]Our father is dying.
[7969][7985]Did you do it?
[7986][8043]He is just so selfish and was|taking too long to die, so
[8043][8069]I decided to move things along.
[8070][8104]Now, why are you here?
[8104][8127]I won't let you leave this planet.
[8127][8160]You are not strong|enough to keep me here.
[8161][8180]Not alone, she isn't.
[8181][8234]Are you referring to your|friend, the chosen one?
[8234][8258]You might want to check up on him.
[8258][8319]He's a little preoccupied right now.
[8319][8348]I don't want to fight you, ahsoka.
[8402][8450]And now the student|will kill the master.
[8505][8528]You're getting ahead of|yourself, aren't you, snips?
[8528][8544]Don'call me that.
[8545][8565]I hate it when you call me that!
[8674][8688]Two jedi.
[8689][8715]Finally, a challenge.
[8775][8813]Can you feel it, sister?
[8813][8885]Can you feel the anger,|the hate, the fury?
[8885][8916]Their conflict is|feeding you, isn't it?
[8916][8938]I must stop them.
[8938][8958]No.
[9068][9117]If you will stand in my way,|then I guess we must fight.
[9365][9378]Any suggestions?
[9378][9387]Yes.
[9388][9418]We cut her free.
[9419][9432]What is that?
[9432][9447]It can kill the son.
[9447][9458][Growls]
[9459][9487]Where did you get that?
[9487][9512]Give it to me.
[9574][9586]Ah!
[9587][9607][Growls]
[9630][9650][Grunts]
[9688][9708]You don't have to do this.
[9709][9732]Then stand aside.
[9768][9783]I can't.
[9783][9803]I won't.
[10190][10211]Stop this!
[10303][10354]So glad you could make it to|our little party, father.
[10355][10388]You will stop this.
[10388][10424]You are too weak for me, old man.
[10425][10444]You mean nothing to me anymore.
[10625][10644]Anakin, now!
[10727][10794]Everything has transpired|exactly as I planned.
[10795][10830]You showed them the altar?
[10830][10848]I am sorry, father.
[10848][10877]I didn't know how else to stop him.
[10878][10914]Give it to me, child.
[10914][10947]Ahsoka, no.
[11005][11020]Thank you.
[11021][11062]Your usefulness has come to an end.
[11088][11108]No!
[11125][11170]The jedi have brought me the|dagger, and you have brought
[11170][11189]yourself.
[11189][11244]Now, father, you will die.
[11244][11256]Father!
[11256][11276][Gasps]
[11328][11362]Why?
[11501][11516]My daughter.
[11517][11534]What have I done?
[11534][11555][Coughs]
[11555][11578]Do not hate him, father.
[11600][11619]It is his nature.
[11620][11640]No.
[11641][11667]All is lost.
[11667][11699]The balance has been broken.
[11699][11739]I thought by bringing|you here, I would...
[11739][11765]But I have destroyed everything.
[11797][11815]Can you help her?
[11815][11834]There is no light.
[11835][11872]The evil has been unleashed, and|the dark side shall consume
[11872][11882]her.
[11882][11900]You must help her.
[11901][11932]I cannot undo what is done.
[11932][11948]There is no hope.
[11949][11959]Yes, there is.
[11959][11979]There's always hope.
[12228][12275]Then let my daughter's last|act be to breathe life
[12275][12299]into your friend.
[12476][12509][Coughing]
[12531][12541][Laughs]
[12542][12557]Hey, snips.
[12558][12599]What's going on?
[12599][12625]Uh, not much.
[12625][12645]It's good to see you.
[12681][12726]As the balance in this world|crumbles, so shall war escalate
[12727][12756]in your galaxy.
[12757][12798]As my son has descended into the|dark side, so have the sith
[12799][12817]gained strength.
[12818][12832]We will stop your son.
[12832][12844]No.
[12845][12867]You must go now.
[12867][12893]He needs your ship|to leave the planet.
[12893][12922]You must leave before he can take it.
[12923][12938]What about you?
[12938][13010]I shall mourn all that I have|done. And all that is yet to be.
[13013][13043][Thunder booming]
