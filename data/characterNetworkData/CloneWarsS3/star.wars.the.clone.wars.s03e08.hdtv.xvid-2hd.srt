00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,224
<i>Evil plans!</i>

7
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:21,138
<i>With the Jedi Council
focused on the war effort,</i>

8
00:00:21,263 --> 00:00:25,227
<i>criminal minds are left unchecked
to spread fear and corruption.</i>

9
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:27,268
<i>Galactic gangster Jabba the Hutt,</i>

10
00:00:27,393 --> 00:00:30,524
<i>has sent bounty hunter
Cad Bane on a nefarious mission,</i>

11
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:33,324
<i>which shall strike at the heart
of the Republic.</i>

12
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:39,288
<i>Meanwhile, the unsuspecting citizens of
Coruscant go about their daily lives....</i>

13
00:00:39,738 --> 00:00:40,843
Wait, no.

14
00:00:41,056 --> 00:00:44,178
The tendrils belong on the main
table between anakin and senator aang.

15
00:00:44,303 --> 00:00:47,208
- Mistress.
- Not that one. The red one.

16
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,298
Senator aang's favorite color is red.

17
00:00:50,386 --> 00:00:54,055
You need to take a breath.
This party will work out.

18
00:00:55,504 --> 00:00:56,568
It has to.

19
00:00:56,893 --> 00:01:00,148
Senator aang holds the deciding vote
on the military oversight Committee.

20
00:01:00,273 --> 00:01:02,102
You know how particular
the roonan are.

21
00:01:02,227 --> 00:01:04,971
I need everything to be perfect.

22
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:07,849
You have nothing to worry about.

23
00:01:09,197 --> 00:01:09,988
Perfect.

24
00:01:10,113 --> 00:01:12,278
For the most important state
banquet of the season,

25
00:01:12,403 --> 00:01:15,241
They send us waiter droids
with malfunctioning digits.

26
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,007
It will be okay.

27
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:20,023
Those are much too large.

28
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:22,253
Have you seen the size
of roonan teeth?

29
00:01:22,378 --> 00:01:23,733
Tiny, tiny.

30
00:01:23,858 --> 00:01:25,243
- Right away.
- Sir?

31
00:01:25,537 --> 00:01:27,294
That won't do at all.

32
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:31,794
This is a social gathering for the
communal taking of sustenance.

33
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:33,999
Your effort evokes the terror of younglings

34
00:01:34,124 --> 00:01:35,970
fleeing a flesh-eating monster.

35
00:01:36,817 --> 00:01:37,831
okay then.

36
00:01:39,604 --> 00:01:40,658
The garnish!

37
00:01:40,972 --> 00:01:41,844
Artoo.

38
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:45,706
I asked you to oversee one
thing, and you allow this?

39
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,900
Threepio, is there a problem?

40
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,633
I'm sorry, my lady,

41
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:55,444
but it appears the dessert is
missing its jogan fruit.

42
00:01:55,788 --> 00:01:56,995
So go get one.

43
00:01:57,542 --> 00:01:59,064
I could not possibly leave now.

44
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,673
- Threepio...
- Fine. Send artoo, then.

45
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:05,352
I'm afraid that may not be
the most appropriate idea.

46
00:02:05,477 --> 00:02:08,794
It was r2-d2 who put us
in this predicament,

47
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,896
Quite inadvertently, I'm sure.

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,294
Please handle this.

49
00:02:15,078 --> 00:02:16,365
Okay, threepio, look.

50
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,767
- I'm sending you on a mission.
- A mission?

51
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:20,681
Yes.

52
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:23,434
Artoo is going along with you.

53
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:26,937
This should be more
than enough credits.

54
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,061
- If you don't get swindled.
- Swindled? Me?

55
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,111
Yes, you. Go there. Come back.

56
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,386
Don't get lost, and
don't get distracted.

57
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:40,125
Of course, master anakin.
Come along, artoo.

58
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:50,445
Lost!

59
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,651
Distracted!

60
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,936
I cannot imagine where master
anakin gets these ideas.

61
00:02:55,465 --> 00:02:57,381
You are the one who gets distracted.

62
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:00,796
You most certainly do.

63
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:03,400
You wander off like a drunken nuna.

64
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,606
I have half a mind to recalibrate
your focusing capacitors.

65
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:13,234
There they are.

66
00:03:14,398 --> 00:03:16,570
The gold one is the target.

67
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,878
Now get down there and do your job.

68
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:21,178
At your service, mr. Bane.

69
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,625
Here we are.

70
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,250
Now, listen and learn.

71
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:33,379
Excuse me, fine sir, but do you
by any chance have jogan fruit?

72
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,089
So I have jogan?

73
00:03:39,123 --> 00:03:41,040
Can a jedi use the force?

74
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:45,733
I shall take that as a yes.
How much would four cost?

75
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,060
How much ya got, my friend?

76
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:51,824
Artoo, make sure you
watch our credits.

77
00:03:53,435 --> 00:03:56,243
My grandpa always told me,
"don't watch your credits.

78
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:57,778
Watch your health."

79
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,572
So while I was watching my health,

80
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,442
Someone stole my credits.

81
00:04:03,593 --> 00:04:05,073
My grandpa.

82
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,981
A cautionary tale indeed.

83
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,728
Might I please purchase
four jogan?

84
00:04:11,488 --> 00:04:14,697
Your lucky day.
Only ones left on the planet.

85
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:15,963
Four credits.

86
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,157
Four? That seems fair.

87
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,675
Each.

88
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,982
I don't need you to tell me
what galactic robbery is,

89
00:04:24,256 --> 00:04:26,364
But what choice do we have?

90
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,195
Very well.
We will take them.

91
00:04:31,745 --> 00:04:33,072
16 credits?

92
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:35,698
I meant 32.

93
00:04:35,823 --> 00:04:37,056
You said four each.

94
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:39,762
Four times four is 16.

95
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:44,853
32's the best deal we got today.
You know how it is. Hard times.

96
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:48,245
Very well.
32 but not one credit more.

97
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,937
You drive a hard bargain.

98
00:04:58,243 --> 00:04:59,256
They're leaving.

99
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:01,750
Todo, move into position.

100
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,347
I have them marked.

101
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:12,424
As if you could have done any better.

102
00:05:12,549 --> 00:05:15,424
Anyway, we still have
eight credits left.

103
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:19,021
Which is all you need to
revitalize the you inside.

104
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:22,325
Excuse me, but were
you speaking to us?

105
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,102
No, I'm talking to the
you you used to be,

106
00:05:25,227 --> 00:05:27,372
that droid fresh
off the assembly line,

107
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:31,186
Once so nimble before joints
squeaked and wiring frayed.

108
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:32,960
You remember that sparkling fellow?

109
00:05:33,183 --> 00:05:35,159
I'm afraid that was a long time ago.

110
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:38,701
- And my friend and I...
- Could use a makeover, Could you?

111
00:05:39,117 --> 00:05:40,435
Well, no.

112
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,208
Our master was most insistent that
we should not deviate from our task,

113
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,965
so this is no time
for self-indulgence.

114
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,245
Come along, artoo.

115
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,892
I said come along, artoo.

116
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,056
He's right.
You should hear me out.

117
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,413
We have no time for this, artoo.

118
00:05:58,538 --> 00:06:01,454
but a trip to a maintenance
bar would take no time at all.

119
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,785
A maintenance bar for droids?

120
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:07,636
after all, why should organics be
the only ones who get pampered?

121
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,156
They should not.

122
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:11,771
That is why right across
the street there is an oasis

123
00:06:11,896 --> 00:06:13,747
of pleasure designed
to put you back

124
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,292
in touch with the original
assembly-line you.

125
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,746
R2-D2, where are you going?

126
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,584
We must get back to the banquet preparation.

127
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:27,546
As head of protocol, it is vital that...

128
00:06:43,497 --> 00:06:45,940
Hello, and welcome To droid spa.

129
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,973
No need for an appointment.
Right this way.

130
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:58,177
Enjoy yourself.

131
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,298
Indignity.

132
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:15,598
Pardon me, sir, but there appears
to have been a terrible mistake.

133
00:07:15,973 --> 00:07:17,144
I don't think so.

134
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:20,166
I'm quite right.

135
00:08:04,082 --> 00:08:05,937
Why are you putting That there?

136
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,150
To find out what's inside.

137
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:10,634
Inside?

138
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:14,284
Just the usual capacitors,
nothing special.

139
00:08:15,012 --> 00:08:18,286
It doesn't get more soothing
than that, does it?

140
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,160
Just sit back.

141
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,198
We'll take care of you.

142
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,870
Ready for your Decarbonizing buff?

143
00:09:00,422 --> 00:09:02,743
I don't want this gibberish.

144
00:09:02,868 --> 00:09:05,043
I want the plans for the senate building.

145
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:07,232
I don't know what you're
talking about.

146
00:09:07,536 --> 00:09:10,628
You're senator amidala's
personal droid.

147
00:09:10,753 --> 00:09:12,259
I am a protocol droid,

148
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,155
Human-cyborg relations.

149
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,469
I can translate and instruct
on appropriate etiquette,

150
00:09:17,895 --> 00:09:19,975
Which in your case, sir,
if you don't mind me saying,

151
00:09:20,286 --> 00:09:21,560
is sorely lacking.

152
00:09:26,793 --> 00:09:30,786
That is exactly the sort of
behavior I am talking about.

153
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,536
According to the analyzer,
he is not lying.

154
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:39,928
His head's totally empty of
any information useful to us.

155
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,692
Empty?
I protest.

156
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:45,230
I am fluent in over 6 million
forms of communication.

157
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:48,145
I have extensive programming
in the correct...

158
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,581
ain't that great...
A brainless droid.

159
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:53,217
Worthless.

160
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:56,172
My lack of knowledge is not
an impediment at all.

161
00:09:56,391 --> 00:09:59,644
Floor plans, blueprints are
not in my programming.

162
00:09:59,857 --> 00:10:02,147
That was always Artoo's speciality.

163
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:03,647
Artoo?

164
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,049
The astromech.

165
00:10:06,596 --> 00:10:08,857
Go fetch me his little pal.

166
00:10:16,406 --> 00:10:18,023
What have I done?

167
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,095
I do not know where your buddy is.

168
00:10:52,328 --> 00:10:54,741
How about taking a look
at these items?

169
00:10:55,024 --> 00:10:59,453
Top-drawer titanium, guaranteed to last
longer than your circuit boards.

170
00:11:01,206 --> 00:11:04,987
If price is the issue, then I'll knock six credits off.

171
00:11:10,015 --> 00:11:11,677
You're coming with us.

172
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:16,943
What are you doing?

173
00:11:17,318 --> 00:11:19,507
What's with the suction thing on the cart?

174
00:11:19,632 --> 00:11:20,929
Take it off--now!

175
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:24,891
Stop him.

176
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:12,705
That's the wrong droid!

177
00:12:14,418 --> 00:12:15,817
Murderer!
Murderer!

178
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:28,304
Swindled? Me?

179
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,370
Might I remind you, sir,
I was once protocol droid to the

180
00:12:32,495 --> 00:12:35,329
chief negotiator for the
entire manakron system.

181
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:36,501
Wait a minute.

182
00:12:36,626 --> 00:12:38,451
You're not master ani.

183
00:12:38,663 --> 00:12:39,549
No.

184
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:42,393
I'm your worst nightmare, pal.

185
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,819
You certainly are.
It's all coming back to me now.

186
00:12:46,954 --> 00:12:51,022
Thanks to you, the only thing
coming back is your little friend.

187
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,140
This is a nightmare.

188
00:12:59,676 --> 00:13:00,943
He is not here.

189
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Bane will not be pleased if we
come back empty-handed.

190
00:13:10,643 --> 00:13:13,875
If the gold one cannot provide
the information In his current state,

191
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:17,430
Then I shall personally
dismantle every circuit In his

192
00:13:17,555 --> 00:13:20,757
plated little body
to get those answers.

193
00:13:21,355 --> 00:13:23,575
That will destroy him.

194
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:41,582
Noble, yes. Wise?

195
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,280
I think not.

196
00:14:12,704 --> 00:14:13,935
Talk to me.

197
00:14:14,193 --> 00:14:15,987
Connections complete.

198
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:17,898
Ready for download.

199
00:14:20,313 --> 00:14:24,965
Your friend goldenrod turned out
to be a huge waste of my time...

200
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:28,575
Something my clients
don't have a lot of.

201
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:32,162
You know what's good for you,

202
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:34,168
You'll give me what I want.

203
00:14:34,293 --> 00:14:35,932
I can't bear to watch.

204
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,951
download that data
onto the memory drive.

205
00:14:53,076 --> 00:14:55,190
I will deliver it immediately.

206
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:59,247
- And prepare my ship.
- What should we do with these two?

207
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:02,785
Wipe their memory and dump
them back in the street.

208
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,693
They'll find their way back home.

209
00:15:05,979 --> 00:15:10,053
We can't have anything looking
out of place, can we?

210
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:22,128
It's so good to see you,
Senator aang.

211
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,211
How good it is to see you,
Senator amidala.

212
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,088
Where can threepio be?

213
00:15:29,514 --> 00:15:31,024
I have no idea.

214
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:57,413
Thanks for the memories.

215
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,668
There you are.

216
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,885
I've been looking all over for you.

217
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:19,403
I'm certain we're late.
We'll be deactivated for sure.

218
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:40,635
Sa da so?

219
00:16:41,527 --> 00:16:44,919
As you requested,
the floor plans of the senate.

220
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,842
I'll be needing my full payment now.

221
00:16:57,707 --> 00:16:59,187
Something funny?

222
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,298
Ta wamma niboba fa.

223
00:17:03,018 --> 00:17:07,400
The almighty jabba requires
further assistance.

224
00:17:07,783 --> 00:17:11,571
Are you saying there's still
more moves to this dance?

225
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:14,282
Chuba noleeya?

226
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,682
Name your price.

227
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,221
I suppose I could rearrange
my busy schedule,

228
00:17:21,434 --> 00:17:23,876
But I'll need details...

229
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:28,214
And an advance on my services
while we negotiate new terms.

230
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,734
Du bargain. Du bargain.

231
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:35,974
And the advance?

232
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,248
Sto settah lordo hutt.

233
00:17:40,699 --> 00:17:45,016
First, the great jabba must
receive the council's approval.

234
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,274
The new assignment must be serious.

235
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,880
Chuba lioya, ichaga soyari.

236
00:17:53,312 --> 00:17:57,277
Jabba wants everyone out except you, Cad Bane.

237
00:18:15,124 --> 00:18:19,166
If it isn't the heads of the five hutt families.

238
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:22,725
Droid, my ancient huttese
is a little rusty.

239
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,394
Tell me what they say.

240
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:30,504
<i>Ziro captura to publiko.
Wanto me che?</i>

241
00:18:31,224 --> 00:18:34,427
Ma hodrada do hodrada.

242
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:40,578
Jabba and arok are debating
how important ziro's release is.

243
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,751
Ziro jeeska nobata.

244
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:51,029
Apparently, ziro holds in his possession
some dangerous information,

245
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,512
dangerous to the hutt council.

246
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:59,012
<i>Ziro vo aga?</i>

247
00:18:59,286 --> 00:19:01,222
Ne rika kong.

248
00:19:01,718 --> 00:19:06,330
Nix takia ziro noleeya kapa.

249
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:11,499
<i>Haku chuba tinka, jabba?</i>

250
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:17,458
Oruba feels the council will be safer
with ziro under their protection.

251
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,741
<i>Kickee tapu?</i>

252
00:19:20,046 --> 00:19:24,161
<i>Haa oto isti chari?</i>

253
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:29,542
They want to know who shall
take on this very dangerous task.

254
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,430
That would be me.

255
00:19:32,576 --> 00:19:34,795
<i>Cad bane at your service.</i>

256
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,008
I'll take on any job...

257
00:19:38,563 --> 00:19:40,114
For the right price.

258
00:19:49,207 --> 00:19:50,778
What are we going to do?

259
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:54,700
Artoo and c-3po have not returned
with the jogan fruit for the cake.

260
00:19:55,855 --> 00:19:57,740
I knew this was gonna happen.

261
00:19:57,953 --> 00:19:59,572
That's why I sent artoo.

262
00:20:00,078 --> 00:20:04,527
To the signing of the treaty
and to my favorite dessert,

263
00:20:04,652 --> 00:20:06,848
Jogan fruitcake. Yes.

264
00:20:13,317 --> 00:20:15,993
I'm never gonna hear the
end of this one.

265
00:20:17,392 --> 00:20:20,412
Threepio, where were you?
You almost missed The whole party.

266
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,929
We encountered some
complications, sir.

267
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,515
What kind of complications?

268
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,780
Actually, I have no
recollection of my day.

269
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:31,271
I cannot really explain
where I have been.

270
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:32,893
Thank you.

271
00:20:36,126 --> 00:20:40,038
One, two, three, four.

272
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:46,941
You're gonna have to
do better than that,

273
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:49,292
because if padme's
dinner is a disaster,

274
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:51,583
then you're not the only
one she's gonna be mad at.

275
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,576
Anakin, stop worrying.
The cake is right here.

276
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,468
You should really lighten
up on these two.

277
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,380
Threepio, you've done
a magnificent job.

278
00:21:03,044 --> 00:21:06,348
My, a magnificent job!

279
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,338
A magnificent job.

280
00:21:11,142 --> 00:21:12,987
A magnificent job.

281
00:21:13,675 --> 00:21:16,941
We're gonna hear about
this one for a while, buddy.

282
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,895
<i>A magnificent job.</i>

283
00:21:20,932 --> 00:21:22,716
A magnificent job.
