1
00:00:15,654 --> 00:00:16,583
<i>Captured!</i>

2
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:19,474
<i>Returning from a perilous
assignment in the Outer Rim,</i>

3
00:00:19,693 --> 00:00:21,576
<i>Jedi Master Even Piell's cruiser</i>

4
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:23,572
<i>has fallen under attack
and been boarded.</i>

5
00:00:24,127 --> 00:00:27,200
<i>Seeking vital information he carries
about secret hyperspace lanes</i>

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,662
<i>called the Nexus Route.
Separatist forces have taken him alive.</i>

7
00:00:31,443 --> 00:00:33,170
<i>Now the Jedi are preparing a stealth</i>

8
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:35,234
<i>mission into the heart
of Separatist space</i>

9
00:00:35,354 --> 00:00:37,152
<i>in an effort to rescue master Piell</i>

10
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:40,493
<i>from the deadly prison
known as the Citadel....</i>

11
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,382
As you are aware,
the citadel is their most isolated

12
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:47,471
and impenetrable detention facility.

13
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:49,647
No one has ever escaped.

14
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:51,687
There's a first time for everything.

15
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:53,049
Indeed there is.

16
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,193
Their security has prevented our probes
from obtaining recent reconnaissance,

17
00:00:57,647 --> 00:00:59,768
so we've been forced
to construct a crude map

18
00:00:59,888 --> 00:01:02,152
based upon data from the archives.

19
00:01:02,486 --> 00:01:04,621
And since the data is extremely old,

20
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:06,564
the map will be difficult to rely on.

21
00:01:06,904 --> 00:01:08,764
So we're essentially going in, blind.

22
00:01:09,014 --> 00:01:10,332
<i>Beg your pardon general,</i>

23
00:01:10,546 --> 00:01:12,781
<i>But how do we know
master Piell is still alive?</i>

24
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:16,484
The Separatists won't dare kill master
Piell until they have what they need.

25
00:01:16,724 --> 00:01:20,672
He obtained the coordinates of a secret
hyperspace lane known as the Nexus route

26
00:01:21,088 --> 00:01:25,602
which travels into the heart of both
the Republic and Separatist homeworlds.

27
00:01:25,883 --> 00:01:27,812
They could prove vital
in maneuvering our forces

28
00:01:27,932 --> 00:01:29,760
deep into remote separatist sectors.

29
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:31,180
Or the enemy could use them

30
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,376
to slip through our defenses
and attack Coruscant.

31
00:01:33,687 --> 00:01:37,370
These hyperspace lanes are
of immense interest to both our sides,

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,637
and could tip the scale of the war to
whomever is in possession of them.

33
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:43,466
That is all.

34
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,780
Based on the archive schematics,

35
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,819
we've narrowed it down to three possible
locations they could be holding him at.

36
00:01:52,137 --> 00:01:54,943
My greatest concern is,
infiltrating their outer security.

37
00:01:55,526 --> 00:01:57,888
The life-form scanners will not
be easy to fool.

38
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,977
I've got a thought about that.

39
00:02:00,482 --> 00:02:01,337
Master.

40
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:03,995
I'm sorry I'm late.
I just heard about the briefing.

41
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,155
We're going to rescue Master Piell, right?

44
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,807
but you won't be coming along on this one.

45
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:22,102
Not coming?
But you're breaking into the Citadel.

46
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:23,443
No one's ever done it.

47
00:02:23,753 --> 00:02:26,067
The citadel wasn't designed
to hold common criminals.

48
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,575
It was created to hold Jedi
if any of us lost our way.

49
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,028
It's not a place for padawans.

50
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:34,417
You're just being protective again.

51
00:02:34,537 --> 00:02:35,614
That's not fair.

52
00:02:35,827 --> 00:02:38,869
How am I supposed to learn
if you won't let me share the risk?

53
00:02:39,162 --> 00:02:42,309
This isn't a mission for learning.
You either do or die.

54
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:45,109
And that's not a risk
I'm willing to share.

55
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:56,187
Artoo, look out behind you.

56
00:02:56,983 --> 00:02:59,106
You're being followed
by battle droids!

57
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,519
These are your troops?

58
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:04,181
They're battle droids.

59
00:03:06,028 --> 00:03:09,344
What do you mean, they've been
reprogrammed to follow your orders?

60
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:13,304
We are awaiting your word, commander.

61
00:03:15,377 --> 00:03:16,854
You heard him.
Move out.

62
00:03:17,603 --> 00:03:20,236
Don't you go thumbing your gears
at me just because you have

63
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:23,048
a bunch of dim-witted
droids following you about.

64
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:23,903
Really.

65
00:03:26,023 --> 00:03:28,695
We're trusting those droids
to get us into the citadel?

66
00:03:28,957 --> 00:03:30,021
It's the only way.

67
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,029
We're flying right into the
heart of separatist territory.

68
00:03:33,564 --> 00:03:35,060
Droids won't be detected.

69
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:42,290
Artoo, make sure they don't
stray from the flight plan.

70
00:03:43,174 --> 00:03:44,952
It's all under control, sir.

71
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,692
I was talking to Artoo.

72
00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:52,977
Master Plo?

73
00:03:53,138 --> 00:03:54,304
May I speak with you?

74
00:03:54,674 --> 00:03:56,500
What is it, little 'soka?

75
00:03:56,978 --> 00:03:58,279
It's about the mission.

76
00:03:58,502 --> 00:04:00,656
Master Skywalker doesn't
want me to go.

77
00:04:01,638 --> 00:04:03,669
That is his choice.

78
00:04:06,057 --> 00:04:09,345
I know, but I think he's
being overly protective.

79
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,684
He's picking and choosing which
assignments I can be a part of.

80
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:14,929
He is your master.

81
00:04:16,148 --> 00:04:17,421
Yes, but

82
00:04:18,014 --> 00:04:21,843
it's not for him to decide when
and how I should put my life in danger.

83
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:23,972
That should be my choice.

84
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,074
I've never been carbon-frozen
before, general.

85
00:04:30,194 --> 00:04:31,959
It's the first time for us too.

86
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,518
This is your idea?
Carbon-freezing?

87
00:04:38,781 --> 00:04:41,209
You wanted to shield us
from the life-form scanners.

88
00:04:41,609 --> 00:04:44,058
Are, we sure this thing is safe.

89
00:04:44,739 --> 00:04:46,546
I don't want to end up
a wall decoration.

90
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,084
Try to relax. We'll be unfrozen
as soon as we arrive.

91
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,514
May the force be with you.

92
00:05:56,434 --> 00:05:58,473
{PUB}Citadel command has contacted us.

93
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:05,504
This is central command.

94
00:06:05,747 --> 00:06:07,623
Please identify yourself.

95
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:10,471
<i>This is shuttle 81572.</i>

96
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:12,790
<i>Requesting access to citadel prison.</i>

97
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:17,215
Make sure every part of that
ship is scanned for life-forms.

98
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,276
Yes, commander.

99
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,240
Make no mistake, the Jedi

100
00:06:22,609 --> 00:06:24,728
will be coming for their
imprisoned brother.

101
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:27,109
They're not about to let one of their own

102
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:30,322
be tortured in the handing
over information that will help

103
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,276
the separatists win the war.

104
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:35,267
What is your cargo?

105
00:06:35,764 --> 00:06:37,387
What is our cargo?

106
00:06:40,347 --> 00:06:42,104
Supplies and frozen rations.

107
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:48,745
Do not deviate from your current course
until we have confirmed your cargo.

108
00:06:49,197 --> 00:06:51,024
They're scanning us for life-forms.

109
00:07:02,744 --> 00:07:04,707
I don't think this is working.

110
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,865
Quiet you're going to blow it.

111
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:21,902
The shuttle has no life-forms,
commander.

112
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,459
Scan complete.

113
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,932
<i>You may proceed.</i>

114
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:32,943
Fear.

115
00:07:33,303 --> 00:07:36,141
A Jedi spends his whole life
training against it,

116
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:39,892
but at the Citadel, breaking
Jedi is our specialty.

117
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,176
Within these walls,
they will learn to fear us.

118
00:07:45,053 --> 00:07:47,152
And if not, they die.

119
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:24,067
Hey, snips.

120
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:25,928
Hey, master.

121
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:33,102
I must have carbon sickness because
I could swear that's Ahsoka.

122
00:08:34,044 --> 00:08:35,188
Your eyes are fine.

123
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:37,167
It's Ahsoka's hearing that needs help.

124
00:08:37,696 --> 00:08:39,999
I received orders to join the team.

125
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:42,030
- I thought you knew.
- Oders?

126
00:08:42,274 --> 00:08:45,228
- From who?
- I discussed it with master Plo.

127
00:08:45,647 --> 00:08:46,957
He didn't tell me.

128
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:49,285
You were already in carbonite.

129
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:52,321
I gave you a specific
order not to come.

130
00:08:53,118 --> 00:08:55,703
If there's one thing I've
learned from you, master,

131
00:08:55,823 --> 00:08:57,967
it's that following
direct orders isn't

132
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:00,164
always the best way
to solve a problem.

133
00:09:00,283 --> 00:09:04,500
I see Anakin’s new teaching method is
to "do as I say, not as I do."

134
00:09:05,181 --> 00:09:06,242
Welcome aboard.

135
00:09:13,227 --> 00:09:14,481
Guard the shuttle, Artoo.

136
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:16,601
We'll contact you when we're
ready for takeoff.

137
00:09:33,637 --> 00:09:35,163
I see the entry point.

138
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,387
You were right.

139
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,915
The wind conditions are too strong for jetpacks.

140
00:09:39,035 --> 00:09:41,402
Yes, we'll have to do it
the old-fashioned way,

141
00:09:42,229 --> 00:09:44,532
with ascension cables
and a steel grip.

142
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:46,876
- I don't think so.
- What do you mean?

143
00:09:47,975 --> 00:09:49,230
Electro-mines.

144
00:09:50,316 --> 00:09:52,699
There's nowhere to put
a grappling hook at that height,

145
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:54,850
And we hit one of those,
the mission's over.

146
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,240
They'll know we're here.

147
00:09:56,635 --> 00:09:59,320
I suppose that means we free-climb it.

148
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:16,710
you hanging in there, snips?

149
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:18,935
Couldn't be better.

150
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:21,840
I could do without the wind though.

151
00:10:28,738 --> 00:10:30,954
The entry point is just
a few more meters.

152
00:11:12,156 --> 00:11:13,458
They locked the door.

153
00:11:13,578 --> 00:11:14,701
It's ray-shielded.

154
00:11:14,862 --> 00:11:15,997
Ray-shielded?

155
00:11:16,117 --> 00:11:17,420
That wasn't the plan.

156
00:11:17,581 --> 00:11:19,398
Well, it's in the plan now.

157
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:23,441
There's an opening up there.

158
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,144
We know they're ventilation ducts,

159
00:11:26,264 --> 00:11:28,612
but they're far too small
for us to gain access.

160
00:11:28,732 --> 00:11:30,099
Too small for you maybe,

161
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:32,179
but I think I can squeeze through.

162
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,137
Well, we hadn't planned
on Ahsoka being here.

163
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,663
Perhaps she's right.

164
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:04,293
See, I can handle myself after all.

165
00:12:08,554 --> 00:12:12,709
Sir, one of the cargo shuttles was
cleared for landing but never arrived.

166
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,050
Charger!

167
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,124
Well, they know we're here.

168
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:38,683
Sir, a mine in sector 9-g
was just detonated.

169
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:40,976
Mindless droids!

170
00:12:41,424 --> 00:12:45,223
Activate all security protocols
lock everything down.

171
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:48,218
Where are my special units?

172
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:50,220
They are here, sir.

173
00:13:04,764 --> 00:13:05,591
Clear.

174
00:13:07,476 --> 00:13:09,021
Take out their surveillance.

175
00:13:27,276 --> 00:13:28,896
The walls are electrified, go!

176
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,075
Go! Go! Go!

177
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:35,994
Longshot!

178
00:13:37,098 --> 00:13:38,362
We must keep moving.

179
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:51,831
You're weakening.

180
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:54,538
You decide when the pain will stop.

181
00:13:55,174 --> 00:13:57,488
Just give me the information.

182
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:00,558
No droid will ever break me.

183
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:04,397
Say good-bye to your
one good eye.

184
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,375
Secure the entrance.

185
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:21,066
Master Piell, are you all right?

186
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,646
Obi-wan.

187
00:14:22,937 --> 00:14:24,866
What took you guys so long?

188
00:14:26,695 --> 00:14:28,843
At least your sense
of humor is still intact.

189
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:32,575
It takes more than they got
to break me, young Skywalker.

190
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:35,665
So you have the coordinates
for the nexus route?

191
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,317
I got them, all right.

192
00:14:37,852 --> 00:14:39,222
Half of them anyway.

193
00:14:39,342 --> 00:14:41,331
My captain's got the other half.

194
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:44,739
I erased the computers when
we were boarded

195
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:47,421
and had both of us
memorize part of the intel.

196
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,687
That way, if somehow I cracked,
the information would be.

197
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,642
useless to them without
the other half.

198
00:14:52,943 --> 00:14:54,109
Where's your captain?

199
00:14:54,702 --> 00:14:57,261
Being held with the other
officers, I assume.

200
00:14:57,737 --> 00:14:59,992
We're going to need a new
plan for getting out.

201
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:42,939
We need to keep moving.

202
00:15:51,213 --> 00:15:52,091
Anakin!

203
00:15:55,332 --> 00:15:56,170
Master!

204
00:16:00,431 --> 00:16:01,771
<i>You fools!</i>

205
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,279
<i>I hope you enjoyed the reunion.</i>

206
00:16:04,726 --> 00:16:08,208
<i>With your fellow Jedi because
you're going to be my guests</i>

207
00:16:08,575 --> 00:16:10,343
<i>for a very long time.</i>

208
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:15,616
They're magnetized.

209
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:29,760
No, you don't.

210
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:51,731
- Are you all right, sir?
- Let's get out of here.

211
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:12,438
I hear something.

212
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:26,014
General.

213
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:27,773
Captain Tarkin.

214
00:17:28,337 --> 00:17:30,339
I never thought I'd see you again.

215
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:32,094
And you brought friends.

216
00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:35,720
Tarkin, this is Obi-Wan Kenobi
and Anakin Skywalker.

217
00:17:36,585 --> 00:17:39,140
Now that you've found us, how
do you expect to get us out?

218
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,854
If they've locked this fortress down

219
00:17:40,974 --> 00:17:42,873
there's at least ten
squads on their way.

220
00:17:43,034 --> 00:17:45,267
It's going to be impossible
to escape.

221
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:46,879
What if we split up?

222
00:17:47,084 --> 00:17:48,736
My team will create a diversion,

223
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:50,530
While Anakin leads the others away.

224
00:17:50,744 --> 00:17:52,472
That way, if one of us is captured,

225
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:54,592
the enemy will only
have part of the information.

226
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,100
And not all of it.

227
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,709
General Kenobi, I think it's
better if we stick together.

228
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,701
A stronger force would have a better

229
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:03,418
chance of protecting the information.

230
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:05,122
Not in this situation.

231
00:18:05,336 --> 00:18:09,417
But surely we'd have more strength
in numbers, rather than divide us.

232
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,458
Obi-wan has a point.

233
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:14,665
I'll go with him,
you go with Skywalker.

234
00:18:38,781 --> 00:18:40,121
They escaped, sir.

235
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:47,283
Captain, show this droid what
happens when we use that word.

236
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,302
Sir, they've been spotted
heading for the upper levels.

237
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:57,674
They're trying to steal a transport.

238
00:18:58,081 --> 00:18:59,588
Seal the landing platform

239
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,338
and send all battalions
to their positions.

240
00:19:02,686 --> 00:19:04,785
Bring 'em back alive.

241
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:46,760
Everybody in.

242
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:00,344
This is one of the original
fortress tunnels.

243
00:20:00,463 --> 00:20:03,006
The advantage of old archive data.

244
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,742
The tunnel's clear.

245
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,386
Looks like Obi-Wan's
distraction worked.

246
00:20:10,506 --> 00:20:12,249
Things seem to be going as planned.

247
00:20:12,598 --> 00:20:15,844
It's when things do not go
as planned that concerns me.

248
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:16,971
What then?

249
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,603
It's when things don't go as planned
that we Jedi are at our best.

250
00:20:20,723 --> 00:20:21,527
Trust me.

251
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:26,167
I reserve my trust for those who
take action, general Skywalker.

252
00:20:26,743 --> 00:20:28,074
Then let me remind you,

253
00:20:28,366 --> 00:20:30,921
We rescued you back there
and I reserve my trust

254
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,916
for those who understand gratitude,
Captain Tarkin.
