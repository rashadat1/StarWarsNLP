1
00:00:15,486 --> 00:00:17,090
<i>A world in crisis!</i>

2
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:19,060
<i>The peaceful planet of Mandalore</i>

3
00:00:19,424 --> 00:00:22,012
<i>is being strangled by
the grip of corruption.</i>

4
00:00:22,285 --> 00:00:23,861
<i>With shortages of every kind,</i>

5
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:27,208
<i>citizens must turn to the black
market in order to survive.</i>

6
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:29,223
<i>Desperate to free her people,</i>

7
00:00:29,384 --> 00:00:32,088
<i>Duchess Satine has asked
her friend Padmé Amidala,</i>

8
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,934
<i>to speak with the Jedi council,</i>

9
00:00:34,054 --> 00:00:37,581
<i>in hopes that they will send assistance
to her struggling world.</i>

10
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:41,629
The Jedi council gives
you a mission Ahsoka.

11
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:43,307
It's your duty to see it through.

12
00:00:43,468 --> 00:00:46,563
Don't you think I’m just
a little over qualified for this ?

13
00:00:47,156 --> 00:00:49,489
According to Senator Amidala,
Mandalore

14
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:51,070
is a deeply corrupt world.

15
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:52,658
If the cycle is to be broken,

16
00:00:52,777 --> 00:00:55,490
the future leaders at the royal
academy of government must learn,

17
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,032
the evils of corruption.

18
00:00:57,193 --> 00:01:00,316
Yoda feels that only a young padawan
like you can get through to them.

19
00:01:15,178 --> 00:01:18,766
My lady, if I may,
what do the jedi know of our ways?

20
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:21,679
Do we really want them meddling
with our children's education?

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,201
Surely there is nothing to fear from
exposing them to new ideas.

22
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,726
Duchess Satine.

23
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:31,842
Prime minister Almec.

24
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:34,763
Master Skywalker,
so good to see you again.

25
00:01:34,883 --> 00:01:36,404
This is your padawan, I assume.

26
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:39,771
Yes, my lady.
May I present Ahsoka Tano?

27
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:42,244
Duchess.
Prime minister.

28
00:01:42,855 --> 00:01:46,122
I am grateful that the Jedi council
could spare the two of you to help,

29
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:49,058
instruct our leaders
and peacekeepers of tomorrow.

30
00:01:49,263 --> 00:01:51,129
Please thank master Yoda for me.

31
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:55,565
I'm afraid that due to our
limited resources,

32
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:57,972
I must return to battle immediately.

33
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:00,692
So you will not be staying,
Master Skywalker?

34
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:01,558
No,

35
00:02:02,103 --> 00:02:05,282
but I assure you, padawan
Tano is a highly capable jedi,

36
00:02:05,614 --> 00:02:07,454
and has the full
confidence of the council.

37
00:02:07,788 --> 00:02:08,654
Very well.

38
00:02:08,815 --> 00:02:10,919
Cadet Korkie, Amis, Lagos.

39
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,835
These are some of the cadets that you
will be instructing, Padawan Tano.

40
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:16,778
Nice to met all of you.

41
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:19,162
That's a fine weapon.
May I see it?

44
00:02:24,772 --> 00:02:27,408
No offworlders may carry
weapons on Mandalore.

45
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:29,746
Master Obi-Wan caused trouble?

46
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:31,301
That's a first.

47
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,278
Just give me the lightsaber.

48
00:02:37,745 --> 00:02:40,824
Thank you for respecting our ways,
master jedi.

49
00:02:41,338 --> 00:02:44,176
Excuse the interruption,
sir, but it is time to depart.

50
00:02:44,296 --> 00:02:47,454
- General Fisto is expecting us.
- If you'll excuse me.

51
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,799
Corruption is what happens
when someone in power,

52
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,673
puts their own personal gain before the
interest of the people they represent.

53
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:08,803
- So it's a result of greed?
- Yes.

54
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:13,664
A leader sacrifices moral integrity
for the sake of money or power.

55
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:16,766
Entire star systems have
collapsed into chaos,

56
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:20,077
or revolution because their greedy
politicians got caught up in a cycle,

57
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,118
of bribery and blackmail
while their people suffered.

58
00:03:23,429 --> 00:03:26,159
Does that mean most
government officials are corrupt?

59
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:27,591
Well... No,

60
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:31,198
but the point is that temptation
is always there,

61
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:34,923
and citizens must be vigilant
so corruption can't take root.

62
00:03:35,273 --> 00:03:36,963
The deadliest enemies of a society,

63
00:03:37,124 --> 00:03:38,638
well within its borders.

64
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:42,099
and from these internal threats,
the people need to be protected.

65
00:03:42,446 --> 00:03:45,307
But if you don't trust your
leaders, isn't that treason?

66
00:03:45,646 --> 00:03:48,080
It's every citizen's duty to
challenge their leaders,

67
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,348
to keep Them honest, and hold
them accountable if they're not.

68
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,888
How do you do that?

69
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:55,448
By exposing corrupt officials
for what they are.

70
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:58,580
Lasting change can only
come from within.

71
00:04:03,887 --> 00:04:06,571
Be sure your assignments
are prepared for tomorrow.

72
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,534
The school's out of rations again.

73
00:04:09,906 --> 00:04:12,414
I guess there'll be no
late-night snacks tonight.

74
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:15,862
Listen, we've had a food shortage
since the war began.

75
00:04:16,177 --> 00:04:17,967
Transport ships keep coming in,

76
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:21,234
but there's strict rationing.
Something is wrong on Mandalore.

77
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:25,249
But these problems are bigger than us.
Just let the authorities handle it.

78
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,170
We have to do something
about it, like Ahsoka said.

79
00:04:28,683 --> 00:04:30,404
Let's go down to the
warehouse district

80
00:04:30,524 --> 00:04:32,904
and see if there really is
a food shortage.

81
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:36,336
Beats sitting around here
listening to my stomach growl.

82
00:04:46,217 --> 00:04:48,599
These doors are heavily
secured by the government.

83
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:50,386
It won't be secure for long.

84
00:04:55,608 --> 00:04:57,417
Looks like the academy taught us well.

85
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,711
Come on. Up and over.

86
00:05:17,522 --> 00:05:19,846
I have a bad feeling about this.

87
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:22,997
- What are you doing?
- Quiet.

88
00:05:23,158 --> 00:05:25,073
It sounds like someone
else is in here.

89
00:05:25,988 --> 00:05:28,519
Let's get out of here.
No, come on.

90
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:35,372
<i>The risk involved makes the price up.</i>

91
00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:39,241
<i>You must be more cautious.</i>

92
00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:41,381
<i>Coming here could raise suspicion.</i>

93
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:43,520
It's a little late for a
meeting, isn't it?

94
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:45,271
Let's get a closer look.

95
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,186
Are you crazy?

96
00:05:56,234 --> 00:05:58,032
<i>It wasn't my idea.</i>

97
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,337
Soniee, quick, use your holocam.

98
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:07,269
Those look like mandalorian police,
but they're unmarked.

99
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:08,854
Who's that?

100
00:06:09,963 --> 00:06:11,333
Who are those guys?

101
00:06:12,214 --> 00:06:14,123
What are offworlders doing
on a secure port?

102
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,306
I don't like this.
I'm getting out of here.

103
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:36,363
Hurry. This way.

104
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:53,154
Hey, no!

105
00:07:18,678 --> 00:07:20,143
What are we going to do?

106
00:07:20,304 --> 00:07:21,810
This is bigger than we thought.

107
00:07:22,102 --> 00:07:23,424
We're going to need help.

108
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:29,861
We should speak to my aunt Satine.

109
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:46,672
Aunt Satine, may we speak with you?

110
00:07:47,996 --> 00:07:49,881
Of course, Korkie.
Come in.

111
00:07:53,992 --> 00:07:55,460
We did some investigating.

112
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,874
There's no food shortage.

113
00:07:57,035 --> 00:07:59,437
We found stores of food at
the government port.

114
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:01,921
How would you know this?

115
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,476
That doesn't matter right now.

116
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:04,712
I beg to differ.

117
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,774
We made a recording
of a secret meeting

118
00:08:06,894 --> 00:08:09,919
between what we know was a government
official and a black marketeer.

119
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,907
That's why everything costs so much,

120
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:13,814
and so many people are starving.

121
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:16,161
We need your help to find
the one responsible.

122
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:18,879
This is a serious matter, I agree,

123
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:22,693
but the source of this evil may be
more than you cadets can handle.

124
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,804
People can be very deceiving.

125
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:27,497
You don't want to get
yourselves into trouble.

126
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:30,325
But, auntie, don't you see?
You can't ignore this.

127
00:08:30,846 --> 00:08:32,508
I won't. Trust me.

128
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:35,483
But for your own safety,
you must let me take care of it.

129
00:08:37,108 --> 00:08:38,556
Now run along, all of you.

130
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,315
Concentrate on your studies.

131
00:08:40,435 --> 00:08:43,000
There will be a time to save the
world when you're a bit older.

132
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,012
She refused to help us because
she doesn't think we can handle it.

133
00:08:52,258 --> 00:08:54,493
She just thinks we're
a bunch of stupid kids.

134
00:08:54,786 --> 00:08:56,867
She acted like nothing was wrong.

135
00:08:57,071 --> 00:08:59,294
We need to find someone
else who believes us.

136
00:08:59,537 --> 00:09:00,519
Like who?

137
00:09:01,296 --> 00:09:03,096
Mandalore has two people in charge.

138
00:09:03,257 --> 00:09:04,695
Since my aunt won't help,

139
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:06,417
We'll have to go to the prime minister.

140
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:08,097
What makes you think he'll listen?

141
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:09,697
I've known him my whole life.

142
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:12,499
He's always told me to me
to him if I'm ever in trouble,

143
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,773
And I'd say we're all in big trouble.

144
00:09:15,968 --> 00:09:19,621
I must concern by this allegations,
my intrepid young cadets.

145
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,862
You think duchess Satine knows
who the conspirator is?

146
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:24,623
She said she was going to handle it.

147
00:09:24,972 --> 00:09:27,063
Meet me in the Palace Plaza tonight.

148
00:09:27,225 --> 00:09:28,571
Bring the recording you took

149
00:09:28,691 --> 00:09:32,440
of the black market deal and all
the cadets who know about it.

150
00:09:39,268 --> 00:09:41,628
You seem distracted today.
What's going on?

151
00:09:41,884 --> 00:09:42,988
We did what you said.

152
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,710
- We found evidence of corruption.
- What do you mean?

153
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:49,342
Well, we were hungry,
so we decided to go look for food.

154
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:50,411
Food?

155
00:09:50,952 --> 00:09:52,631
Down at the government warehouse.

156
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,072
Someone just let you in
to inspect the warehouse?

157
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:59,394
- No, we broke in.
- Oh, great!

158
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:01,154
So you committed a crime.

159
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:05,029
It sounds bad, I know, but then we
saw a meeting and offworlders...

160
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,316
And they chased us.

161
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:08,773
Maybe they chased you
because you broke

162
00:10:08,894 --> 00:10:10,797
into a government warehouse.

163
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,701
No, it was a black market Deal.
I know it.

164
00:10:13,993 --> 00:10:17,162
My aunt Satine told us to stay out
of it, but we must do something.

165
00:10:17,602 --> 00:10:18,599
Do you have proof?

166
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:20,196
We made a holo-recording.

167
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:22,514
The prime minister is
meeting us tonight to...

168
00:10:23,162 --> 00:10:24,721
Are you sure that's a good idea?

169
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:27,405
I thought you said it was
the duty of every citizen

170
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:29,748
to expose corrupt officials.

171
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:33,038
I'm only saying that you
should take this slowly.

172
00:10:33,158 --> 00:10:34,765
Examine all of the facts,

173
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,949
and all of the people
involved before you act.

174
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:42,062
You sound more like my
aunt than a jedi knight.

175
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,111
You Korkie?

176
00:11:00,878 --> 00:11:02,764
Prime minister, is that you?

177
00:11:03,136 --> 00:11:04,311
Secret service.

178
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:07,607
You're all under arrest for treason,
corruption, and conspiracy.

179
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:09,808
You will come with us.

180
00:11:10,138 --> 00:11:11,937
These are the same guards
we saw last night.

181
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,091
We've done nothing wrong.

182
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:35,864
Looks like the prime
minister set you up.

183
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:37,199
That's treason.

184
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:40,154
He's the leader of our system.
He couldn't possibly be a traitor.

185
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:41,661
We need proof.

186
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,392
We have the recording.

187
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:50,190
That's no good.
You can't see who it is.

188
00:11:50,515 --> 00:11:52,236
Wait. Stop right there.

189
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:57,697
Information retrieval.
I need you to I.D. a hologram.

190
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,972
- That's him!
- You're right.

191
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,555
That is the prime minister.

192
00:12:07,716 --> 00:12:09,812
We have to take this to
my aunt and warn her.

193
00:12:10,941 --> 00:12:12,408
They know I talked to her.

194
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:19,639
We're too late.

195
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,475
He's dead.

196
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,602
Korkie, wait.
The intruders may still be inside.

197
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:32,176
They took her.

198
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:34,161
This is all my fault.

199
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,676
Who knows what they've done to her.

200
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:49,809
Now what?
How are we supposed to find her?

201
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,329
Who can we trust?

202
00:12:51,607 --> 00:12:53,932
I need all of you to calm
down and focus.

203
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,571
We know the prime
minister is behind this.

204
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,371
After my aunt, he's the most
powerful person on Mandalore.

205
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,630
So let's go talk to him.

206
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:14,700
Master jedi, this is
an unexpected pleasure.

207
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,192
What can I do for you?

208
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:19,635
Actually, prime minister,
It's what I can do for you.

209
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:29,490
I believe some of my students are
involved in a conspiracy against you.

210
00:13:30,346 --> 00:13:31,464
Intriguing.

211
00:13:41,382 --> 00:13:44,282
You can't do this!
We trusted you, master Tano.

212
00:13:46,581 --> 00:13:49,552
Thank you for bringing the
traitors to justice, master jedi.

213
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:52,362
They mentioned that duchess
Satine was their leader.

214
00:13:52,482 --> 00:13:53,822
We should arrest her too.

215
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:57,078
Do not worry.
We already have her in custody.

216
00:13:57,613 --> 00:13:59,100
Really? Where?

217
00:13:59,587 --> 00:14:01,064
That is none of your concern.

218
00:14:01,226 --> 00:14:05,196
Now, I must prepare a public statement
about the duchess and her crimes.

219
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,353
Officer, I need to interrogate the
prisoners Immediately.

220
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:49,520
Careful.

221
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:51,241
We're being watched.

222
00:14:51,402 --> 00:14:53,642
Did he buy it?
Have you found my aunt?

223
00:14:53,803 --> 00:14:55,003
Not exactly,

224
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:57,323
but I know they have her in custody.

225
00:14:57,484 --> 00:15:00,195
- Where?
- The prime minister wouldn't tell me.

226
00:15:00,545 --> 00:15:02,490
I knew this plan wouldn't work.

227
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,693
Have a little faith.

228
00:15:05,231 --> 00:15:06,267
I'll find her.

229
00:15:06,612 --> 00:15:08,246
We'll just modify the plan a bit.

230
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,047
How are you going to do that?

231
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,328
Don't worry. You'll know when
to act when I give the signal.

232
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,569
What's the signal?

233
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,732
You'll know it when you see it.

234
00:15:19,598 --> 00:15:22,222
You will take me to duchess Satine.

235
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:25,120
I will take you to duchess Satine.

236
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:55,909
What are you doing?

237
00:15:57,134 --> 00:15:59,536
I must interrogate the duchess.

238
00:15:59,843 --> 00:16:02,788
You must interrogate the duchess.

239
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,549
I'm getting you out of here.

240
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,429
Ahsoka, it's a trap.

241
00:16:20,591 --> 00:16:22,813
I see you found the duchess,
youngling.

242
00:16:23,074 --> 00:16:25,351
You may stop your
playacting now, sergeant.

243
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,152
Prime minister, sir!

244
00:16:29,793 --> 00:16:32,564
Using a jedi mind trick was a
very poor decision.

245
00:16:33,374 --> 00:16:36,320
My guards have been trained to
resist such archaic magic.

246
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,491
And now you have revealed
yourself as a conspirator.

247
00:16:41,757 --> 00:16:43,051
Set for stun.

248
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,288
You little fool.

249
00:16:48,126 --> 00:16:49,303
Where is she?

250
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,403
Stick to Ahsoka's plan.

251
00:16:51,523 --> 00:16:53,885
But how do we do that?
It's falling apart.

252
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:55,693
Ahsoka wants us to wait for a signal,

253
00:16:55,813 --> 00:16:57,321
and that's what we're going to do.

254
00:16:59,747 --> 00:17:03,666
Sigit. Sign the confession and
admit to your treasonous ways.

255
00:17:04,288 --> 00:17:07,848
There is only one traitor to
Mandalore here, prime minister,

256
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:09,238
and that's you.

257
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,617
You control the black market.

258
00:17:12,086 --> 00:17:13,807
You have betrayed the public trust,

259
00:17:13,968 --> 00:17:16,607
and used your office to
accumulate wealth and power.

260
00:17:17,115 --> 00:17:18,087
It's shameful.

261
00:17:19,244 --> 00:17:22,978
Your idealism is inspiring,
my dear, but hopelessly naive.

262
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,671
I established the black market
for the people.

263
00:17:26,177 --> 00:17:27,411
That's absurd.

264
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:30,290
The war is disrupting trade across the galaxy.

265
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,582
The profits from the black
market are being used to,

266
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:35,645
purchase humanitarian
supplies for Mandalore.

267
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:39,489
Think of it as a new tax in the
interest of national security.

268
00:17:40,237 --> 00:17:43,057
It's a tax for your benefit,
Prime minister.

269
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,170
Where are these humanitarian
supplies you speak of?

270
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,405
Sergeant, put the shock
collar on her.

271
00:17:50,982 --> 00:17:53,052
My patience has worn thin, duchess.

272
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,780
Maybe this will convince you.

273
00:18:02,354 --> 00:18:05,104
I would rather die than sign
your confession.

274
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:07,002
That can be arranged.

275
00:18:07,264 --> 00:18:09,384
You're wasting your time.

276
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:13,001
Bring me those traitorous Cadets.

277
00:18:14,713 --> 00:18:16,747
No, you can't.
They're just children.

278
00:18:22,676 --> 00:18:24,109
All right, let's move.

279
00:18:31,155 --> 00:18:33,867
I'm afraid your nephew will
have to suffer needlessly.

280
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,104
Put the shock collar on cadet Korkie.

281
00:18:48,118 --> 00:18:48,763
Go!

282
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,365
Got ya.

283
00:19:21,918 --> 00:19:23,553
Stop fighting.

284
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:31,530
Send for my personal guards.

285
00:19:47,695 --> 00:19:51,417
You must know by now that
I didn't bring you here just to teach.

286
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,725
I knew something was amiss,
but I had no one to trust.

287
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:56,581
I thought if I brought a jedi,

288
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,925
Especially a friend
of senator Amidala's,

289
00:19:59,045 --> 00:20:01,220
we could solve this mystery together.

290
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:02,920
I never doubted you, duchess.

291
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,486
Neither did we.

292
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,152
It was an honor to serve with a jedi knight.

293
00:20:19,627 --> 00:20:21,960
It was my privilege to be your teacher.

294
00:20:27,873 --> 00:20:30,149
I hope this assignment wasn't
too boring for you.

295
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:32,093
Ah, it had its moments.

296
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:36,613
Like the one where you convinced
untrained children to help you

297
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:38,287
you overthrow a corrupt Government?

298
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:40,495
That was a highlight.

299
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:42,391
It sounds pretty risky.

300
00:20:42,663 --> 00:20:46,193
- You're lucky you didn't get hurt.
- Nothing you wouldn't have done.
