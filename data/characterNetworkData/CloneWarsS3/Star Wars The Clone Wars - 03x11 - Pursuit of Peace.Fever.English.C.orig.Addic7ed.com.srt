00:00:10,597 --> 00:00:14,981
Truth can strike down the spectre of fear.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,684
Peace shattered.

6
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,573
Once-promising negotiations
between the Republic and

7
00:00:21,693 --> 00:00:25,686
the separatists are now in
shambles following a droid suicide

8
00:00:25,806 --> 00:00:28,460
bombing on the capitol
city-planet of Coruscant.

9
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:33,533
As fear and anger prevail,
the senate overwhelmingly passes

10
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:36,636
a bill to deregulate the banks,
opening the gateway

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,433
to additional troops and
an increase in fighting.

12
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:47,361
Members of the senate, please, please...

13
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,148
How dare they?

14
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:52,218
They attack,
and now they want peace?

15
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:55,888
Chancellor Palpatine,
may I remind the senators that

16
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:58,891
the peace proposal was made
prior to their assault.

17
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:02,862
That only highlights
its insincerity.

18
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:07,300
Chancellor Palpatine,
in light of this unprovoked attack

19
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:11,003
on Coruscant and the
vulnerabilities it raises,

20
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:16,448
I propose the Republic purchase an
additional 5 million clone troopers.

21
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:19,879
The Republic is already
operating in deep debt.

22
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,715
How do you propose we pay
for these additional troops?

23
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,419
My people are drafting an
emergency appropriations bill

24
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,989
- that would raise funds...
- from the banking clan?

25
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,390
Yes, of course.

26
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,560
Do you have an alternate means of paying?

27
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:38,164
One alternative might be to
stop the war, not escalate it.

28
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,361
- Traitor!
- Traitor!

29
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:41,834
No!

30
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,569
You cannot believe her.

31
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:47,740
Whoever attacked the power grid
wants us to continue to fight.

32
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,611
It's a calculated attempt to
destroy the peace process.

33
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,213
Not everyone in the confederacy wants this.

34
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,048
I know this for a fact.

35
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,651
You have separatists
friends, senator?

36
00:01:58,685 --> 00:01:59,986
Whose side are you on?

37
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,454
What?

38
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,256
We will not stand for this.

39
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:11,658
Please, the young senator
from Naboo makes a point.

40
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:13,852
There is no need to...

41
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,447
We have just received a
message from our opponent,

42
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:23,567
Count Dooku.

43
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:30,537
Your Republic forces have carried
out a barbaric attack on our people,

44
00:02:31,499 --> 00:02:36,705
and among the deaths was the
very sponsor of the peace accord,

45
00:02:37,065 --> 00:02:39,677
senator Miina Bonteri.

46
00:02:39,797 --> 00:02:41,193
What? No.

47
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,726
With her needless death,

48
00:02:44,196 --> 00:02:49,314
I must formally withdraw the proposal
for peace offered by our senate.

49
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,538
We must not show weakness.

50
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,683
Thank you, Teckla.

51
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:04,784
Yes, my lady.

52
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,485
I can't believe it.

53
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,056
I just can't believe the Republic
would target senator Bonteri.

54
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,987
She was the only one willing
to stand up for peace.

55
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:14,899
You shouldn't believe it.

56
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:17,593
The Republic spies are
reporting that senator Bonteri

57
00:03:17,713 --> 00:03:19,663
was murdered by Dooku's thugs.

58
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:23,285
That message to the senate was a
ploy to disguise his true actions.

59
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:26,505
I am so sorry, Padme.

60
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,573
If your friend met with a violent
end because of her politics,

61
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:32,578
let's make sure her courageous
effort wasn't in vain.

62
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:33,913
What can we do?

63
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,515
For one, defeat this bill.

64
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,385
Can we really win this war
with the troops that we have?

65
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,487
Let's hope we don't have to.

66
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:44,023
I'll start lining up support,
but I'll need ammunition.

67
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,007
We can't afford ammunition,
remember?

68
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,797
I joke.

69
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,667
Go to the banking clan and
see how much interest they're

70
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,135
going to charge for the loan.

71
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,905
The more I know about what the
exact cost of this bill will be,

72
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,141
the better I can make my case to defeat it.

73
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,043
Right, let's go, uncle.

74
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,178
You know these
banking clan people.

75
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:09,582
Plus, you owe me for
telling such a bad joke.

76
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,953
Tee ta poo shan aka.

77
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:19,258
We will lend the Republic at our
standard interest rate of...

78
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,694
25%.

79
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,263
- What?
- 25%.

80
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,298
That's outright theft.

81
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,502
Your previous arrangement
with the Republic was 10%.

82
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:33,739
Please, please,
that was before deregulation.

83
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:37,343
The same rules don't apply,
my dear.

84
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:41,147
The separatists don't
seem to mind a rate hike.

85
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:45,518
In fact, they just secured a
loan to fund an additional

86
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:48,654
3 million battle droids.

87
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,422
They would wipe us out.

88
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,558
You would let Dooku do that?

89
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,027
You live on Coruscant too.

90
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:59,009
We have no stake in this war,
senator. You know that.

91
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:04,295
War is... Distasteful to all of us.

92
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,545
25% interest.

93
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,345
That's a lot of credits.

94
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,049
The interest alone could
completely bankrupt the Republic.

95
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,219
As it is, social services have
suffered because of this war,

96
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,923
education, infrastructure, health care.

97
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,723
If we go deeper into debt, the basic
needs of our people will evaporate.

98
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:31,297
- This is good.
- It is?

99
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,025
Clearly taking out a loan
on such obscene terms

100
00:05:34,145 --> 00:05:35,911
would essentially
destroy the Republic,

101
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:37,903
regardless of the
outcome of the war.

102
00:05:38,023 --> 00:05:40,713
We only need to sway another
handful of senators,

103
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,908
as long as they don't
buckle to the threats.

104
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,337
What threats?

105
00:05:44,457 --> 00:05:46,678
Some members have
received messages,

106
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:49,345
warning them not to vote against the bill.

107
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:52,351
Considering what's happened
to your friend Bonteri,

108
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,951
they're frightened.

Millions of clones

The only winner will be the banking clan.

119
00:06:29,213 --> 00:06:31,826
They want to pass
this bill so badly,

120
00:06:31,946 --> 00:06:34,695
they're using scare tactics to sway votes.

I happen to believe more clones

00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:07,156
In the meantime, I'll pay another
visit to those still undecided.

166
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:20,382
I'll be parked just over there, my lady.

167
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:21,317
Thank you.

168
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:22,893
This way, uncle.

169
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:28,390
What does ideology matter at this point?

170
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:30,797
Is it worth being beaten to death?

171
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:33,462
Look at what they did to you.

172
00:09:33,497 --> 00:09:35,704
These wounds will heal,

173
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:39,126
but what about the millions
who are dying in this war?

174
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:40,269
Who?

175
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:41,570
The clones?

176
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:45,007
We created them for
just that purpose.

177
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,942
They are people.

178
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:51,013
The people I care about
are my constituents,

179
00:09:51,047 --> 00:09:53,708
the ones who put me in office.

180
00:09:53,952 --> 00:09:57,720
And when was the last time you
ever spoke to your people?

181
00:09:57,754 --> 00:10:00,603
Probably the same time you did,

182
00:10:01,056 --> 00:10:02,889
or you, senator.

183
00:10:05,945 --> 00:10:07,813
Senator Christo, please,

184
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:10,733
is there anything we can do to
get you to change your mind?

185
00:10:12,836 --> 00:10:16,698
Where does senator
Organa stand on all this?

186
00:10:16,818 --> 00:10:18,174
Why isn't he here?

187
00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:21,942
Senator Organa is preparing to
speak before the full senate.

188
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:24,079
Senator Organa?

189
00:10:24,114 --> 00:10:28,083
Hmm, I'll listen to what he has to say.

190
00:10:28,118 --> 00:10:30,452
So you are open to voting with us?

191
00:10:30,487 --> 00:10:34,883
I said I'll listen to what he has to say.

192
00:10:56,227 --> 00:10:58,514
Well, it's better than a no,

193
00:10:58,818 --> 00:11:01,803
and I'm sure when Christo and the
others hear what bail has to say,

194
00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:03,490
they will vote our way.

195
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,296
Can I give you a ride?

196
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,556
My driver's only a block away.

197
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:09,258
I think I'd like to walk.

198
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:12,754
- But, Padme...
- Don't worry, uncle Ono,

199
00:11:13,188 --> 00:11:14,930
I can take care of myself.

200
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,333
Plus, I can use the fresh air.

201
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:20,002
Just be careful.

202
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:50,363
Oh, yeah...

203
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,867
Put your hands up.

204
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,960
Arrest these bounty hunters.

205
00:12:18,995 --> 00:12:20,716
We'll take care of this, miss.

206
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:24,500
Drop your weapons and come with us quietly.

207
00:12:25,635 --> 00:12:27,603
Quietly?

208
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:34,810
Where's my driver?

209
00:12:34,844 --> 00:12:36,812
Where's my...

210
00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:46,422
Hey, my ride!

211
00:13:58,828 --> 00:14:00,796
My eyes!

212
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,835
Land the vehicle.

213
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:42,104
That is a stolen vehicle.

214
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:45,607
Those bounty hunters
were trying to kill me.

215
00:14:45,642 --> 00:14:46,708
I am a senator.

216
00:14:46,743 --> 00:14:48,810
I demand that you arrest them.

217
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:51,246
Get your hands in the air.

218
00:15:01,264 --> 00:15:02,434
Ouch.

219
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:05,785
Don't you think you should
report this to the jedi council?

220
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,506
There's nothing they can do.

221
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:10,042
I know who did it.

222
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,172
They were bounty hunters,

223
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:15,455
paid to stop me from voting
against the troop increase.

224
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:20,001
What has happened to democracy?

225
00:15:20,272 --> 00:15:23,315
And why doesn't
anyone seem to care?

226
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,089
You do.

227
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,228
Forgive me, my lady.

228
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:31,063
Um, you're not like
most politicians.

229
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,232
If only that were enough, Teckla.

230
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,342
Well, you actually
talk to the people,

231
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,407
people like me.

232
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:44,939
- Good night, my lady.
- Teckla,

233
00:15:46,532 --> 00:15:49,606
tell me, how is your family?

234
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:51,241
They are fine.

235
00:15:51,505 --> 00:15:54,459
How is the war affecting them?

236
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:56,847
Well, it hasn't been easy,

237
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:59,026
and it's only getting worse.

238
00:15:59,146 --> 00:16:00,258
How?

239
00:16:00,514 --> 00:16:02,586
Please, tell me.

240
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,821
Tell me how it's geting worse.

241
00:16:28,212 --> 00:16:32,849
You're not gonna get away like
your lady friend, senator.

242
00:16:32,884 --> 00:16:35,352
Senator.

243
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:13,101
Medic!

244
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,589
Oh, Padme.

245
00:17:16,928 --> 00:17:18,829
- What is it?
- You must come quickly.

246
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:21,064
You need to see something.

247
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,037
Bail, what happened?

248
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,907
- Padme...
- Senator, you need to lie down.

249
00:17:30,942 --> 00:17:34,911
My speech, my speech...
The senate is expecting me.

250
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:36,446
Is there any way?

251
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:38,982
I'm sorry. He's in no
condition to even stand.

252
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:40,784
We need to take him
to the hospital.

253
00:17:40,818 --> 00:17:42,452
Of course. Take him at once.

254
00:17:42,487 --> 00:17:44,806
The speech... Padme,

255
00:17:44,926 --> 00:17:47,157
you must address the senate.

256
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,653
Only you can do this.

257
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:57,467
Perhaps we should get the vote started.

258
00:17:57,502 --> 00:18:01,238
I told senator Organa
I'd allow him to speak.

259
00:18:01,272 --> 00:18:03,540
We have waited long enough.

260
00:18:03,574 --> 00:18:06,977
I agree with senator Orn free Taa.

261
00:18:07,011 --> 00:18:08,445
Let's vote.

262
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:10,714
You must give the
speech in his place.

263
00:18:10,748 --> 00:18:13,650
But they're expecting to hear
from the great bail Organa.

264
00:18:13,684 --> 00:18:15,252
He carries a certain weight.

265
00:18:15,286 --> 00:18:17,554
He's seen as a voice of reason.

266
00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:19,956
You are very respected.

267
00:18:19,991 --> 00:18:21,558
As a partisan.

268
00:18:21,592 --> 00:18:23,660
I've been against this bill from day one.

269
00:18:23,694 --> 00:18:27,164
If they didn't listen to me before,
why would they listen now?

270
00:18:27,198 --> 00:18:29,733
Because you do listen.

271
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:34,050
You understand what the
people are going through.

272
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:36,248
Please.

273
00:18:38,737 --> 00:18:41,097
Your people are waiting for you.

274
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:48,016
Let us now vote on senator
Burtoni's bill to fund

275
00:18:48,136 --> 00:18:50,320
5 million additional clones.

276
00:18:50,354 --> 00:18:54,491
The opposition to this bill
must be allowed to speak first.

277
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:58,542
Unfortunately, senator Organa
is nowhere to be found.

278
00:18:58,996 --> 00:19:01,565
I will speak on his behalf.

279
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:09,539
Senator Amidala will be permitted to speak.

280
00:19:13,077 --> 00:19:14,845
Teckla Minnau.

281
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:15,979
<i>What did she say?</i>

282
00:19:17,915 --> 00:19:20,383
Teckla is one of my aides.

283
00:19:21,346 --> 00:19:25,297
Like so many of the people that we
tell ourselves we're here to serve,

284
00:19:26,013 --> 00:19:30,417
Teckla lives in a district that rarely
has electricity and running water

285
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:33,130
as a result of the war.

286
00:19:33,164 --> 00:19:37,033
Her children can now only
bathe every two weeks,

287
00:19:37,068 --> 00:19:41,872
and they have no light in which
to read or study at night.

288
00:19:42,287 --> 00:19:45,865
The Republic has always
funded these basic services,

289
00:19:46,377 --> 00:19:47,583
but now,

290
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:51,114
there are those who would
divert the money to the war

291
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:55,118
with no thought for what
the people need to survive.

292
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,926
If not for people like Teckla
and her children, who are we

293
00:19:59,046 --> 00:20:00,914
fighting for?

294
00:20:01,228 --> 00:20:06,062
My people, your people, all of our people.

295
00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:09,725
This war is meant to
save them from suffering,

296
00:20:10,147 --> 00:20:12,101
not increase it.

297
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:14,581
I support our brave soldiers,

298
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:17,104
whether they come from the clone factories

299
00:20:17,224 --> 00:20:20,916
or from any of the thousands of
systems loyal to the Republic,

300
00:20:21,794 --> 00:20:24,523
but if we continue to
impoverish our people,

301
00:20:24,643 --> 00:20:28,244
it is not on the battlefield
where Dooku will defeat us,

302
00:20:28,536 --> 00:20:30,987
but in our own homes.

303
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,376
Therefore,

304
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:34,202
it is our duty

305
00:20:34,322 --> 00:20:36,620
and our responsibility

306
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,266
to preserve the lives of those around us

307
00:20:40,386 --> 00:20:43,047
by defeating this bill.

308
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:49,239
Well done, Padme.

309
00:21:21,134 --> 00:21:23,130
Isn't it remarkable,

310
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,425
that one can have all
the power in the galaxy,

311
00:21:26,948 --> 00:21:30,157
and yet the words of a single senator,

312
00:21:30,436 --> 00:21:33,273
can sway the thoughts of millions?

313
00:21:33,552 --> 00:21:36,186
What do you plan to do about this?

314
00:21:36,768 --> 00:21:40,812
For now, we must adhere to the
principles of our democracy.

315
00:21:43,488 --> 00:21:47,778
We must let the wheels of the senate turn.
