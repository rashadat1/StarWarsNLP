1
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:17,648
<i>Mysterious deaths.</i>

2
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:21,924
<i>Unknown to the Jedi, a new threat
has been unleashed on the galaxy...</i>

3
00:00:22,344 --> 00:00:23,673
<i>Savage Opress,</i>

4
00:00:23,793 --> 00:00:25,702
<i>a pawn in the dangerous game between</i>

5
00:00:25,863 --> 00:00:28,324
<i>Count Dooku and his
former assassin, Ventress.</i>

6
00:00:28,703 --> 00:00:31,801
<i>The victims of his brutal
massacre on the planet of Devaron,</i>

7
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:34,861
<i>are being returned to the
Jedi temple for evaluation.</i>

8
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:40,159
<i>It's up to the Jedi council to find this
mysterious killer and eradicate him.</i>

9
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:56,525
There were no survivors on Devaron.

10
00:00:56,645 --> 00:00:59,984
Everyone was killed, including
master Halsey and his padawan.

11
00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:04,537
In the past, only Dooku's assassin
was capable of such an effort,

12
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:08,188
but she was presumed dead
at the battle of Sullust.

13
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,620
Not everything is what it seems.

14
00:01:11,144 --> 00:01:13,118
There may be a new threat.

15
00:01:13,404 --> 00:01:16,199
Someone or something has eluded us.

16
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,555
Perhaps a new apprentice Sith Lord.

17
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:23,277
This is not the work of a
Sith Lord or a Jedi

18
00:01:23,598 --> 00:01:25,697
but a reckless, impulsive animal.

19
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:52,478
You have no technique.

20
00:01:58,878 --> 00:01:59,637
Sloppy.

21
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,715
But with the proper training,
you could be a powerful warrior.

22
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,758
You have a natural ability,
but we must hone it.

23
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:16,800
Are you up for the challenge of
putting your hate to better use?

24
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,164
Yes, master.

25
00:02:23,152 --> 00:02:25,141
Master Yoda, you called for me?

26
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:29,164
Master Kenobi,
show you something we must.

27
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:33,392
We have recovered surveillance
footage of the massacre on Devaron.

28
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:38,639
Darth Maul alive?

29
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:40,451
It can't be.

30
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:42,225
I killed him myself.

31
00:02:42,386 --> 00:02:44,183
Correct you are, Obi-Wan.

32
00:02:44,523 --> 00:02:47,944
A creature of the same species he is,
from Dathomir.

33
00:02:48,105 --> 00:02:49,135
Dathomir?

34
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:51,273
The planet of the witches?

35
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:54,822
I was under the impression that
Darth Maul's home world was Iridonia.

36
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:57,501
Dathomir is the planet
where Maul was raised.

37
00:02:57,662 --> 00:03:00,829
Iridonia is where the rest of
the males of the species dwell.

38
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:03,723
Travel to Dathomir you must.

39
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:07,047
Find the source of
this threat you will.

40
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:15,258
You must strengthen your connection
with the force, my apprentice.

41
00:03:16,045 --> 00:03:18,115
Feel its power within you.

44
00:03:52,354 --> 00:03:54,443
What you ask is impossible.

45
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,358
Impossible?

46
00:03:57,592 --> 00:04:01,051
The task is only impossible
because you have deemed it so.

47
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:04,346
You must connect with your hatred.

48
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,710
Focus on your power building.

49
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:13,868
Do not think of anyone
or anything else.

50
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:19,799
That's it.

51
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:22,894
Your anger is your strength.

52
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,363
I hate you.

53
00:04:27,014 --> 00:04:27,820
Good.

54
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,059
How does one defend
against such power?

55
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,908
A wise master does not
reveal all his secrets at once.

56
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,912
In due time, my apprentice.

57
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:03,307
There's the village.

58
00:05:13,757 --> 00:05:15,001
Be on guard.

59
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:18,149
These men are ferocious warriors,
and they will show no mercy.

60
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,007
Don't worry.
I won't start anything.

61
00:05:25,382 --> 00:05:27,662
Let me handle the negotiations.

62
00:05:39,028 --> 00:05:41,379
So much for not starting something.

63
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:42,945
Don't look at me.

64
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:46,073
Don't harm them.

65
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:48,246
Don't tell me, tell them.

66
00:05:56,282 --> 00:05:57,229
Back off.

67
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,672
We are not here to fight you.

68
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,907
We're here for information.

69
00:06:06,268 --> 00:06:08,513
A man from your village
murdered two Jedi.

70
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,547
We need to know where he is.

71
00:06:10,843 --> 00:06:13,214
What makes you think
he is one of ours?

72
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:15,872
The Jedi council knows
he's from this village.

73
00:06:16,226 --> 00:06:17,484
We have seen him.

74
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,605
Mother Talzin should
know of his whereabouts.

75
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:24,092
One of her women took him as a mate.

76
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,381
I apologize for the intrusion then.

77
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:30,021
Anakin, kindly release him, please.

78
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,989
Stop!

79
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:41,641
Let them go.

80
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:44,262
Who is this mother Talzin?

81
00:06:44,593 --> 00:06:48,432
She's the leader of an ancient
order of witches, the nightsisters.

82
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:51,463
Great. Warrior-like men, witches...

83
00:06:51,705 --> 00:06:55,174
- This place has all kinds of fun.
- I'm glad you think so.

84
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:11,890
You have completed
the first stages of your training,

85
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:15,343
and I am sending you on
an assignment to Toydaria.

86
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,404
You will bring me king
Katuunko, alive.

87
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:23,049
Kill all who might interfere.

88
00:07:23,846 --> 00:07:25,051
Yes, my master.

89
00:07:25,526 --> 00:07:26,801
It will be done.

90
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:42,978
I don't know much of mother Talzin,

91
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:45,397
but I don't expect to be
welcome here.

92
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:48,674
You never know.
I tend to be popular with the ladies.

93
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:49,753
Too popular.

94
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,385
We've got company.

95
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,946
Jedi, come with us.

96
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:36,938
Master Kenobi.

97
00:08:37,472 --> 00:08:38,503
Mother Talzin,

98
00:08:39,173 --> 00:08:40,961
thank you for your hospitality.

99
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,963
I believe you have
a question for me.

100
00:08:44,545 --> 00:08:45,964
Yes, you're right.

101
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:49,094
We've had reports of a
Dathomiri male on the loose.

102
00:08:49,213 --> 00:08:51,376
He's already killed two Jedi.

103
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:53,462
Perhaps you know who he is?

104
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:57,354
Master Jedi, we have no
control over the males.

105
00:08:57,985 --> 00:09:00,706
Our clan has been
in exile for years.

106
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,329
Don't play innocent with me, mother.

107
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:07,518
Everyone in the galaxy knows females
are dominant on this planet.

108
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:11,287
I do not believe anything happens
here without your clan knowing about it.

109
00:09:11,777 --> 00:09:16,724
To think that the Jedi collect their
facts from mere rumors.

110
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,495
You call two dead Jedi rumors?

111
00:09:23,014 --> 00:09:26,472
This thing, this animal,
is extremely dangerous.

112
00:09:26,754 --> 00:09:30,368
If you have any information about his
whereabouts, you must tell us.

113
00:09:35,352 --> 00:09:38,131
Savage. Savage Opress.

114
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,075
Mother?

115
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:42,255
He is on Toydaria.

116
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:43,945
Thank you.

117
00:09:49,478 --> 00:09:51,110
The time has come, sister.

118
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:56,202
You must put your plot against
Dooku into effect now.

119
00:09:56,686 --> 00:09:58,126
He isn't ready, mother.

120
00:09:58,246 --> 00:09:59,684
He needs more training.

121
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,527
He has to be ready.

122
00:10:02,363 --> 00:10:06,162
Together the two of you will be
able to eliminate the count.

123
00:10:06,764 --> 00:10:08,980
But you must act now.

124
00:10:09,321 --> 00:10:12,920
We cannot keep your new
assassin a secret forever.

125
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:15,600
I will have my revenge.

126
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:18,369
You will, sister.

127
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:19,729
You will.

128
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,160
Your highness,
there is an intruder at the door.

129
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,151
Stop him!

130
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:26,729
I will not be intimidated.

131
00:11:48,535 --> 00:11:49,303
At last.

132
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:49,307
I guess that's what's
left of our ship.

133
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:51,309
We'll borrow one from
the Toydarians.

134
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:23,255
You ignorant beast.

135
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:26,131
I told you I wanted him alive.

136
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:34,168
Forgive me, my master.

137
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:37,523
That is not the way
of the dark side.

138
00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:47,662
Ventress.

139
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,920
That's no way to treat
your apprentice.

140
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:53,140
I should know.

141
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:58,221
Savage, you can make
amends for your mistake,

142
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,514
by destroying this witch.

143
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,502
I don't think that will be happening,
will it, Savage?

144
00:14:07,852 --> 00:14:11,759
Remember where your
true loyalties lie.

145
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:14,595
With you, mistress.

146
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,326
{PUB}Look. A separatist dreadnought.

147
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,311
The king's murderer
must have fled there.

148
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:28,131
Dooku sent his assassin to exact
his revenge on the Toydarians.

149
00:14:28,461 --> 00:14:29,931
We'll make him pay for it.

150
00:14:41,588 --> 00:14:43,167
Halt!
You are now...

151
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:08,076
Finish him now!

152
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,655
Get up.

153
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:39,071
We must defeat him.

154
00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:40,658
Get up.

155
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:45,026
Kill him.

156
00:15:45,532 --> 00:15:47,223
Kill him, you fool!

157
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:54,162
I can't.

158
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:56,348
He's too powerful.

159
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:00,805
Your weakness will
not be my downfall.

160
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:05,366
A failed apprentice makes
for a foolish master.

161
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:11,783
Savage, no!

162
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:40,904
- We'll take him together.
- Right.

163
00:16:50,402 --> 00:16:52,705
Leaving so soon, master?

164
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:57,479
You are no match for me
without the aid of your monster.

165
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,209
That remains to be seen.

166
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:02,543
As you wish.

167
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,839
Time to end this once and for all.

168
00:17:56,795 --> 00:17:59,795
<i>Commander,
Savage Opress is a traitor.</i>

169
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,966
<i>- Destroy him.
- Roger, roger.</i>

170
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,708
They're attacking that monster.

171
00:18:35,392 --> 00:18:37,393
You're not supposed to be here.

172
00:18:39,104 --> 00:18:42,022
- No sense in hanging around here.
- My thoughts exactly.

173
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:11,487
You have come home to us.

174
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:22,034
I was betrayed by Ventress.
The Jedi are after me.

175
00:19:22,154 --> 00:19:25,131
I'm not nearly strong enough
to defeat them all.

176
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:26,440
Calm yourself.

177
00:19:27,422 --> 00:19:28,598
You will be.

178
00:19:30,951 --> 00:19:32,843
I don't understand.

179
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,168
Who will teach me?

180
00:19:34,528 --> 00:19:36,248
You have a brother.

181
00:19:37,044 --> 00:19:38,075
A brother?

182
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,955
But all of my kin were killed.

183
00:19:41,674 --> 00:19:42,986
Not all of them.

184
00:19:44,347 --> 00:19:47,776
He lives in the outer rim in exile.

185
00:19:48,418 --> 00:19:49,961
You will find him.

186
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:54,722
He will teach you
everything you need to learn

187
00:19:54,842 --> 00:19:58,142
to become even more powerful.

188
00:19:59,217 --> 00:20:00,277
My brother...

189
00:20:01,986 --> 00:20:03,434
How will I find him?

190
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:08,030
This talisman has been imbued
with the power of our clan.

191
00:20:08,526 --> 00:20:10,752
It will be your compass.

192
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,342
You have an important
destiny to fulfill, Savage Opress...

193
00:20:20,197 --> 00:20:23,026
You and your brother.

194
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:24,535
Go.

195
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:28,816
You will know where to find him.

196
00:20:31,323 --> 00:20:32,877
I will return, mother.
