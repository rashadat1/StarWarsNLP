00:00:16,403 --> 00:00:18,437
Conflict With no end in sight.

3
00:00:18,472 --> 00:00:22,208
Across the galaxy, the
quagmire of war continues.

4
00:00:22,242 --> 00:00:25,111
While clone troopers suffer
casualties at alarming rates,

5
00:00:25,145 --> 00:00:27,713
The galactic senate convenes
an emergency session

6
00:00:27,747 --> 00:00:30,649
To debate the true cost of the war.

7
00:00:30,684 --> 00:00:31,484
Order.

8
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:33,219
Order.

9
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:36,055
Let senator Saam finish.

10
00:00:36,089 --> 00:00:38,524
This is a matter not of philosophy.

11
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:40,426
More troops are needed.

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,661
The Republic cannot afford
to let the separatists

13
00:00:42,696 --> 00:00:44,196
gain any more ground.

14
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:46,298
Our generals inform us
that troops in the field

15
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,734
continue to perform valiantly.

16
00:00:48,768 --> 00:00:51,570
What we cannot afford,
is to be irresponsible.

17
00:00:51,605 --> 00:00:55,875
The Republic is near bankruptcy
due to the cost of this war.

18
00:00:58,178 --> 00:01:01,413
Bankruptcy is not
necessary, my friends.

19
00:01:01,448 --> 00:01:05,718
If we pass senator Saam's bill
to open new lines of credit,

20
00:01:05,752 --> 00:01:08,621
We will gain access
to the needed funds.

21
00:01:08,655 --> 00:01:12,358
Won't this bill essentially
deregulate the banks?

22
00:01:12,392 --> 00:01:16,729
A small price to pay To
finance the war, is it not?

23
00:01:16,763 --> 00:01:19,031
We must keep the war going.

24
00:01:19,065 --> 00:01:20,699
Get a bill on the table!

25
00:01:20,734 --> 00:01:22,201
Keep the war going.

26
00:01:22,235 --> 00:01:24,870
Members of the senate.

27
00:01:24,905 --> 00:01:26,539
Do you hear yourselves?

28
00:01:26,573 --> 00:01:30,409
More money, more clones, more war.

29
00:01:30,443 --> 00:01:32,411
Say nothing of fiscal responsibility,

30
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:35,147
What about moral responsibility?

31
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:37,183
Hasn't this war gone on long enough?

32
00:01:37,217 --> 00:01:40,619
Senator Amidala, are you
suggesting we surrender

33
00:01:40,654 --> 00:01:41,887
to the separatists?

34
00:01:41,922 --> 00:01:43,889
Of course not.

35
00:01:43,924 --> 00:01:46,892
But negotiation might be a
better course of action.

36
00:01:46,927 --> 00:01:50,095
You can't negotiate
with those animals.

37
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,231
Keep the war going.

38
00:01:52,265 --> 00:01:53,065
Vote now.

39
00:01:56,503 --> 00:02:01,473
Members of the senate, I suggest
we table any emergency bill

40
00:02:01,508 --> 00:02:04,476
Until it is determined
whether or not deregulation

41
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:07,580
Is the right course of action.

42
00:02:07,614 --> 00:02:08,581
Very well.

43
00:02:08,615 --> 00:02:12,618
We shall let calmer heads prevail.

44
00:02:17,657 --> 00:02:21,427
That legislation would have
meant billions for us.

45
00:02:21,461 --> 00:02:23,529
I tried my best To
push the bill through.

46
00:02:23,563 --> 00:02:26,265
You did your part, representative.

47
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:29,101
Senator Amidala is the problem.

48
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:33,339
I thought age might
temper her idealism.

49
00:02:33,373 --> 00:02:36,942
I know people who could
do something about her.

50
00:02:36,977 --> 00:02:40,312
That task is more difficult
than you presume.

51
00:02:40,347 --> 00:02:43,148
Gentlemen, the banking
clan and trade federation

52
00:02:43,383 --> 00:02:46,485
Are about business, not violence.

53
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:50,823
Hmm, in this case, our
business is violence.

54
00:02:50,857 --> 00:02:52,224
Precisely.

55
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:55,027
With or without senator
Amidala, the galactic senate

56
00:02:55,061 --> 00:03:00,766
Is unlikely to deregulate The banks.
until this war hits home.

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,471
What exactly are you proposing?

58
00:03:05,505 --> 00:03:08,707
Perhaps some unexpected
bloodshed on Coruscant,

59
00:03:08,742 --> 00:03:11,210
Uh, may change a few minds.

60
00:03:11,244 --> 00:03:12,378
Coruscant?

61
00:03:12,412 --> 00:03:16,315
Coruscant has not been
attacked in over 1,000 years.

62
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:19,018
Then it has a false sense of security.

63
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:21,920
There are some powerful clients
On the other side who could

64
00:03:21,955 --> 00:03:26,992
Help us, uh, Shall we
say, make the point?

65
00:03:27,027 --> 00:03:29,128
Ooh, I like this plan.

66
00:03:29,162 --> 00:03:32,931
No one cares what you think.

67
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:38,404
You must ask the jedi council
To speak with chancellor

68
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:39,338
Palpatine.

69
00:03:39,372 --> 00:03:40,706
Don't involve me in this.

70
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,743
A peaceful solution ls the only
way out of this morass of war.

71
00:03:44,778 --> 00:03:46,612
That's not my role, Padme.

72
00:03:46,646 --> 00:03:48,480
Why not?

73
00:03:48,515 --> 00:03:50,149
Why isn't it your role?

74
00:03:50,183 --> 00:03:51,517
Aren't we jedi knights?

75
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:55,120
Isn't it our duty to speak our
minds to advise the chancellor?

76
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:58,590
Uh, I suggest you teach
my young padawan

77
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,426
A thing or two about politics.

78
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,862
After today's debate, I was
hoping she learned a great deal.

79
00:04:03,897 --> 00:04:06,765
Truthfully, I don't
understand any of it.

80
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,868
I know the separatists are evil,
But all anyone argued about

81
00:04:09,903 --> 00:04:13,505
was banking deregulation,
lnterest rates, and, well,

82
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,176
Almost nothing about why We're
fighting in the first Place.

83
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,644
War's complicated, Ahsoka.

84
00:04:18,678 --> 00:04:20,679
But let me simplify it.

85
00:04:20,714 --> 00:04:22,881
The separatists believe
the Republic is corrupt,

86
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,984
But they're wrong, and we
have to restore order.

87
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:28,754
Maybe talking to the jedi
council isn't the role for you

88
00:04:28,788 --> 00:04:30,222
after all.

89
00:04:30,256 --> 00:04:31,590
Thanks for your help.

90
00:04:31,624 --> 00:04:34,727
Come on, Ahsoka.

91
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:35,994
Hey.

92
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:38,263
You told me to teach
her about politics.

93
00:04:38,298 --> 00:04:40,966
So I'm going to.

94
00:04:45,438 --> 00:04:49,441
There is a problematic situation
brewing in the senate.

95
00:04:49,476 --> 00:04:52,745
We must insure that everything
my master has set in motion

96
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,847
Does not unhinge.

97
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:59,017
My representatives ln the Republic
are relying on you, general.

98
00:04:59,052 --> 00:05:02,087
See that your droids
complete their mission.

99
00:05:02,122 --> 00:05:04,356
But of course, Count.

100
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:09,862
They will not fail.

101
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:12,798
If only I could talk
to senator Bonteri.

102
00:05:12,832 --> 00:05:13,799
Who's he?

103
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,368
He is a she, a senator
in the confederacy

104
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:19,037
Of independent systems.

105
00:05:19,072 --> 00:05:20,973
Your friend is a separatist?

106
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:22,808
One of Dooku's pawns?

107
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:25,844
The separatists used to be
a part of the Republic.

108
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,247
I was close with many of
the senators who left.

109
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:31,517
I may not agree with them,
but they're more than pawns.

110
00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:34,052
If you think negotiating
is the right thing to do,

111
00:05:34,087 --> 00:05:35,154
Let's talk to her.

112
00:05:35,188 --> 00:05:37,423
The senate's made it illegal.

113
00:05:37,457 --> 00:05:38,457
Illegal?

114
00:05:38,491 --> 00:05:41,026
They say official meetings
would only legitimize

115
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,428
The separatists.

116
00:05:42,462 --> 00:05:45,364
Well, master Skywalke
and I hold what we call

117
00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:48,033
aggressive negotiations all the time.

118
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:52,404
It's a shame you can't hold more
peaceful talks When you want.

119
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,906
You just gave me an idea.

120
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,209
You're a jedi, which gives
you special clearance.

121
00:05:57,243 --> 00:05:58,710
Right.

122
00:05:58,745 --> 00:06:02,481
And jedi are allowed to travel to
neutral worlds like Mandalore,

123
00:06:02,515 --> 00:06:04,016
Where we could then board

124
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:06,819
A cargo ship to a separatist System.

125
00:06:06,853 --> 00:06:10,622
Are you suggesting I use
my status as a jedi

126
00:06:10,657 --> 00:06:13,358
To smuggle you behind Enemy lines?

127
00:06:13,393 --> 00:06:15,794
It's just that you could get
Us through to meet with her

128
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:20,466
And I haven't seen her Or
her family in so long.

129
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:20,732
Relax.

130
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:21,667
I'll help you.

131
00:06:21,701 --> 00:06:24,403
Besides, master Skywalke
Said you should teach me

132
00:06:24,437 --> 00:06:25,204
About politics.

133
00:06:25,238 --> 00:06:26,705
Right.

134
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:29,208
You know, you two have more
ln common than you think.

135
00:06:29,242 --> 00:06:31,176
It's no wonder you get along Well.

136
00:06:31,211 --> 00:06:32,144
Huh.

137
00:06:32,178 --> 00:06:33,278
Of course.

138
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:35,481
So where are we heading?

139
00:06:35,515 --> 00:06:38,917
Raxus.

140
00:06:38,952 --> 00:06:41,453
Have all the preparations Been made?

141
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:44,556
I'm about to deploy The infiltrators.

142
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:45,457
You must hurry.

143
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:47,226
The senate is restless.

144
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:54,466
I don't take orders from
you, only count Dooku.

145
00:06:55,768 --> 00:06:58,737
You have been designed
for this mission

146
00:06:58,771 --> 00:07:02,207
to be the ultimate infiltration units.

147
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:04,977
Some of you may not return.

148
00:07:05,011 --> 00:07:08,113
Actually, none of you Will return.

149
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:10,816
But don't let that get ln your way.

150
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,985
Is that clear?

151
00:07:23,062 --> 00:07:25,430
Get them to Coruscant.

152
00:07:25,465 --> 00:07:28,066
Roger, roger.

153
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,704
Move along, please.

154
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:08,839
Move along.

155
00:08:08,874 --> 00:08:11,809
Identification, please.

156
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:17,315
Excuse me.
Is this platform b?

157
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:19,358
Uh, platform b... this way.

158
00:08:24,657 --> 00:08:26,424
Hello, old friend.

159
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:28,927
Ahsoka, this is Miina Bonteri.

160
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:31,896
She was my mentor when I
was growing up on Naboo.

161
00:08:31,931 --> 00:08:34,065
You're a separatist?

162
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,700
Well, of course, my dear.

163
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:37,001
What were you expecting?

164
00:08:37,036 --> 00:08:37,969
Now, come.

165
00:08:38,003 --> 00:08:40,905
I have a transport waiting.

166
00:08:55,262 --> 00:08:57,564
Lux, come down here
and help our guests

167
00:08:57,598 --> 00:09:00,233
With their luggage, please.

168
00:09:05,105 --> 00:09:08,474
Padme, it's so good to see you.

169
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:09,642
Yes.

170
00:09:09,677 --> 00:09:12,278
How things have changed
since the last time we met.

171
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:13,513
Let's go inside.

172
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:15,081
There's much to discuss.

173
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:16,710
Please, allow me.

174
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:20,053
May I?

175
00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:21,605
I can handle it.

176
00:09:30,064 --> 00:09:32,198
He's grown so much, Miina.

177
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:35,668
Time won't stop, even
if we are at war.

178
00:09:35,703 --> 00:09:39,772
And I'm afraid tse events
Are shaping his young life.

179
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:42,375
With all due respect, As a separatist,

180
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:44,510
Didn't you create this war?

181
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:45,445
Ahsoka!

182
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:47,113
It's all right.

183
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:50,083
That's a very polarized
point of view, my dear.

184
00:09:50,117 --> 00:09:52,919
Would it surprise you to
know that many of the people

185
00:09:52,953 --> 00:09:56,522
You call separatists feel the
same way about the Republic

186
00:09:56,557 --> 00:09:58,291
And the jedi?

187
00:09:58,325 --> 00:10:01,527
Lux's father was like that.

188
00:10:01,562 --> 00:10:03,730
Maybe I could speak with him.

189
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:06,159
If only you could.

190
00:10:07,034 --> 00:10:08,744
A year ago next week,

191
00:10:09,662 --> 00:10:13,272
he was setting up a base
on Aargonar when clones attacked.

192
00:10:13,307 --> 00:10:16,882
My husband fought bravely in
self-defense,

193
00:10:17,002 --> 00:10:19,512
but was killed.

194
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:22,415
Excuse me.

195
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:25,038
I think I'll get some air.

196
00:10:38,165 --> 00:10:39,665
Ah, the cleaning droids.

197
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,800
Finally.

198
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:41,734
Don't waste any time.

199
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:42,735
Get to work.

200
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,921
You're a jedi, aren't you?

201
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:03,055
Yes.

202
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,657
Why do you ask?

203
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:07,927
Before the war, I was
always told jedi were good.

204
00:11:07,961 --> 00:11:10,088
And now?

205
00:11:11,098 --> 00:11:12,799
I don't know anymore.

206
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:16,335
There are lot of terrible things
happening, a lot of killing.

207
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:19,572
And now my friends are saying
the jedi are to blame.

208
00:11:19,606 --> 00:11:23,009
I'm the first jedi you've
ever met, aren't I?

209
00:11:23,043 --> 00:11:24,786
Well, um...

210
00:11:24,906 --> 00:11:26,746
Yes.

211
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,265
Look at me.

212
00:11:28,385 --> 00:11:30,699
I'm not so bad, am I?

213
00:11:35,556 --> 00:11:37,523
No, not bad at all.

214
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:38,591
Uh.

215
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,427
Well, it seems boys are the
same whether they're Republic

216
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:43,763
Or separatist.

217
00:11:43,797 --> 00:11:45,565
Wait.

218
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:47,333
How many separatists have you met?

219
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:48,501
What?

220
00:11:48,535 --> 00:11:50,736
Well, I mean, you think
we're all the bad guys.

221
00:11:50,771 --> 00:11:53,573
But how many of us
have you actually met?

222
00:11:53,607 --> 00:11:55,107
And droids don't count.

223
00:11:55,142 --> 00:11:59,579
Well, other than military officers
like Grievous and Ventress,

224
00:11:59,613 --> 00:12:01,314
None, I guess.

225
00:12:01,348 --> 00:12:03,316
You and your mother are the first.

226
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,151
Well, look at me.

227
00:12:05,185 --> 00:12:09,021
Am I so bad?

228
00:12:09,056 --> 00:12:12,325
I sense Dooku's dirty
hand ln all of this.

229
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:14,060
He's just the leader of the senate.

230
00:12:14,094 --> 00:12:16,729
He's not the leader of
the entire universe.

231
00:12:16,763 --> 00:12:18,965
Oh, I forgot.

232
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:21,200
You actually admire the man.

233
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:25,137
We'll never entirely agree
on Dooku, my old friend,

234
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:28,140
But we can agree on the
need to stop this war.

235
00:12:28,175 --> 00:12:30,142
The question is how.

236
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:32,812
That is why it was so urgent
that I speak with you.

237
00:12:32,846 --> 00:12:35,414
The Republic senate is holding
a critical vote on whether

238
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:37,550
or not to escalate the war effort.

239
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:41,888
However, many of the delegates
are undecided as to what to do.

240
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,689
How interesting.

241
00:12:43,724 --> 00:12:47,793
You would find the separatist
parliament in a similar dilemma.

242
00:12:47,828 --> 00:12:50,396
I am certain if you could
convince your representatives

243
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,199
to extend an olive branch of
peace towards the Republic,

244
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:55,835
there might be enough sympathy
ln the senate to finally

245
00:12:55,869 --> 00:12:57,635
 open negotiations.

246
00:12:57,755 --> 00:13:00,072
I admire your spirit, Padme.

247
00:13:00,107 --> 00:13:02,975
I can at least put the
motion on the floor.

248
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,610
Thank you, Miina.

249
00:13:04,645 --> 00:13:08,381
That's all I ask.

250
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:11,083
To peace, then.

251
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,520
To hope.

252
00:13:19,593 --> 00:13:23,696
How many lives on both sides
have to end before we see

253
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,398
the futility?

254
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:28,367
Surely there's room in the
galaxy for confederate

255
00:13:28,402 --> 00:13:30,903
and Republic planets to coexist.

256
00:13:30,938 --> 00:13:34,140
I move that we immediately
open peace negotiations

257
00:13:34,174 --> 00:13:36,776
with chancellor
palpatine on Coruscant.

258
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:42,281
The corporate alliance will
never allow this to happen.

259
00:13:42,316 --> 00:13:45,217
This is a democracy, and
unlike the Republic,

260
00:13:45,252 --> 00:13:47,520
corporations do not rule us.

261
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:49,922
Nay!

262
00:13:49,957 --> 00:13:52,325
Quiet.

263
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:55,161
In accordance with the bylaws
of independent systems,

264
00:13:55,195 --> 00:13:57,630
a voice vote is required.

265
00:13:57,664 --> 00:14:00,099
All in favor of initiating
peace negotiations with

266
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:03,836
the galactic Republic, say aye.

267
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,704
Aye.

268
00:14:04,738 --> 00:14:05,371
Aye.

269
00:14:05,405 --> 00:14:06,138
Aye.

270
00:14:06,173 --> 00:14:07,340
Aye.

271
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:09,408
All those opposed.

272
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:10,643
Nay.

273
00:14:10,677 --> 00:14:12,878
Nay.

274
00:14:12,913 --> 00:14:15,848
The ayes have it.

275
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:26,058
This is quite troubling, your own
senate voting to end the war.

276
00:14:26,093 --> 00:14:29,829
I assure you, gentlemen, your
worries are gravely exaggerated.

277
00:14:29,863 --> 00:14:33,766
How can you be sure this groundswell
of peace won't continue?

278
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,801
Where is the attack we were promised?

279
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:39,638
We need fighting to feed the
machine and our profits.

280
00:14:39,673 --> 00:14:43,809
After our attack, the chances
of peace will disappear.

281
00:14:43,844 --> 00:14:47,146
The banking clan, the trade
federation, and the techno union

282
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:52,084
will all get their fair
share and then some.

283
00:14:56,823 --> 00:14:58,858
Well, this is good-bye.

284
00:14:58,892 --> 00:15:03,596
I've been disappointed before,
and yet, I almost feel as if

285
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:07,533
this time the tide has
turned in the war.

286
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:09,602
You should hurry.

287
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:13,205
Goody-bye, young one.

288
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,175
You really believe the
Republic will vote for peace?

289
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:17,376
I hope so.

290
00:15:17,411 --> 00:15:20,534
I wouldn't want to meet you on
the battlefield, 

291
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,356
for your sake.

292
00:15:24,584 --> 00:15:27,553
Go, you two, quickly.

293
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,047
Team leaders, come in.

294
00:15:45,371 --> 00:15:47,272
Commence phase two.

295
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:15,878
All right, everybody
have your passes out.

296
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:31,779
Hmm, generator maintenance, eh?

297
00:16:33,128 --> 00:16:35,976
Yeah, well, everything checks out.
Good luck down there.

298
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:44,067
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

299
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,651
Power generators are that way.

300
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,275
Stupid droids.

301
00:17:00,008 --> 00:17:01,679
Well, well, well.

302
00:17:01,713 --> 00:17:04,215
This is quite a stunning development.

303
00:17:04,249 --> 00:17:07,852
Your excellency, we would be
remiss, if not irresponsible,

304
00:17:07,886 --> 00:17:10,020
to reject the separatists proposal.

305
00:17:10,055 --> 00:17:11,889
Of course.

306
00:17:11,923 --> 00:17:14,158
An end to the fighting,
would mean there's no need

307
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:16,360
to borrow money for more clones.

308
00:17:16,394 --> 00:17:18,929
I can see why you would
Want so badly to believe

309
00:17:18,964 --> 00:17:21,866
That the separatists Desire peace.

310
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,801
I don't understand.

311
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:27,838
In the past, whenever we've
reached out our hands in peace,

312
00:17:27,873 --> 00:17:30,207
They've been slapped away.

313
00:17:30,242 --> 00:17:34,378
Can we believe that they're ready
to sue for peace so easily?

314
00:17:34,412 --> 00:17:37,748
If I might speak with
you confidentially,

315
00:17:37,782 --> 00:17:39,850
I know that this is sincere.

316
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:42,987
I've been in contact with
my old friend Miina Bonteri,

317
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,589
And the origin of the
proposal is with her.

318
00:17:45,624 --> 00:17:47,424
Bonteri?

319
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:49,793
How was the dialogue established?

320
00:17:49,828 --> 00:17:53,664
Does it matter, chancellor,
if the result is an end to the war?

321
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:56,100
I see your point, my child.

322
00:17:56,662 --> 00:17:59,418
Then we shall put the
vote to the floor.

323
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:17,922
Sweeper droids?

324
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:19,821
We didn't schedule a cleaning.

325
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:29,433
Oh!

326
00:18:33,305 --> 00:18:35,973
What's going on?

327
00:18:53,058 --> 00:18:55,559
Given that the separatists have
put a call for negotiations

328
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:57,032
On the table,

329
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:59,897
the need for additional
troops seems ill-timed.

330
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,001
Which means there is no need
to deregulate the banks.

331
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:07,191
I say we vote that down now.

332
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:24,822
There is a move to vote on the
proposed bill to lift regulations

333
00:19:24,856 --> 00:19:26,757
On the banking clan.

334
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,827
Dooku promised he
would stop this vote.

335
00:19:31,596 --> 00:19:34,698
You may enter your vote.

336
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,283
We're under attack!

337
00:20:17,343 --> 00:20:19,996
The bombing of the power
Generator has been confirmed

338
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,283
As a separatist attack.

339
00:20:22,403 --> 00:20:24,608
They must pay for what they have done.

340
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:27,737
But was the separatist congress
that issued the bill of peace.

341
00:20:27,771 --> 00:20:31,965
Obviously a tactic to lower our
defenses and launch this attack.

342
00:20:32,085 --> 00:20:33,209
No.

343
00:20:33,244 --> 00:20:34,711
That's not true.

344
00:20:34,745 --> 00:20:39,315
I move to immediately
deregulate the banks.

345
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:43,486
We need a banloan to
get more troops now.

346
00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:45,906
What are we waiting for?

347
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,499
I'm afraid we've been
given little choice.

348
00:20:51,362 --> 00:20:53,796
to insure the safety of the Republic,

349
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:56,900
We must deregulate the banks.

350
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:17,053
I'm returning your padawan.

351
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:19,923
I'm sorry your talks
with Bonteri failed.

352
00:21:19,957 --> 00:21:21,424
How did you know?

353
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,964
We have eyes and ears
everywhere, Ahsoka.

354
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:26,821
That was dangerous and
careless, going to Raxus,

355
00:21:26,941 --> 00:21:28,698
Not to mention illegal.

356
00:21:28,732 --> 00:21:30,917
You went too far this time.

357
00:21:31,969 --> 00:21:33,510
You would do the same.

358
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,271
You do the same all the time.

359
00:21:35,306 --> 00:21:37,574
This was too much.

360
00:21:37,608 --> 00:21:38,641
Maybe so.

361
00:21:38,676 --> 00:21:40,643
But I did realize something.

362
00:21:40,678 --> 00:21:42,418
The politics of this war,

363
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:45,138
are not as black and white
as I once thought they were.
