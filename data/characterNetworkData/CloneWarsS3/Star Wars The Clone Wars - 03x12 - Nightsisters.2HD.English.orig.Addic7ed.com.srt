00:00:16,597 --> 00:00:17,830
Galactic showdown!

5
00:00:17,896 --> 00:00:20,865
In a fierce battle for survival,
the Republic and separatist

6
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:24,202
armies have clashed in the
distant sullust system.

7
00:00:24,236 --> 00:00:27,606
Count dooku's most cunning
assassin, asajj ventress,

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,975
leads the vicious attack.

9
00:00:37,717 --> 00:00:41,487
Trident group one, attack
the starboard engines.

10
00:00:43,324 --> 00:00:47,127
Trident group two, knock out
their port shield generators.

11
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:49,829
I'll go directly for their bridge.

12
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:58,671
The port side deflectors are gone.

13
00:01:18,728 --> 00:01:20,428
Lord tyranus.

14
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:22,330
My master.

15
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:26,168
There is a disturbance in the force.

16
00:01:26,202 --> 00:01:31,706
Your assassin, she has
become very powerful.

17
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:33,276
Yes, my lord.

18
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,444
She is quite important to me.

19
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,446
Too important.

20
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:39,115
Master...
Silence.

21
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:42,685
I can sense her powers
growing stronger.

22
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,955
I would hate to think you
are training your own sith

23
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:49,292
apprentice to destroy me.

24
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:50,327
Never.

25
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:53,363
My allegiance is to you and you alone.

26
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:55,599
Then you must prove it.

27
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:57,401
Eliminate her.

28
00:01:57,435 --> 00:02:02,973
She's my most trusted...
I said eliminate her!

29
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:07,345
As you wish, my lord.

30
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:15,353
Ventress.

31
00:02:15,387 --> 00:02:16,187
Split up.

32
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:24,063
Looks like I'm her favorite.

33
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:27,499
I'm kind of disappointed.

34
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:31,203
Only the droids follow me.

35
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:36,275
You want to race?

36
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:39,011
Come on.

37
00:02:54,262 --> 00:02:56,263
Anakin, I'm going to need some help.

38
00:02:56,297 --> 00:02:57,398
Where are you?

39
00:03:07,943 --> 00:03:08,576
Clang!

40
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,510
I'm hit!

41
00:03:09,544 --> 00:03:11,479
I'm heading toward the
separatist flagship.

42
00:03:11,513 --> 00:03:12,380
I see you.

43
00:03:12,414 --> 00:03:13,882
I've got her.

44
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:31,734
Master, I need your help quickly.

45
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:33,236
I'm surrounded.

46
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,673
You have already lost
the battle, child.

47
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:39,809
I've ordered your
reinforcements to return.

48
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:40,610
No.

49
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:42,545
I will destroy the jedi.

50
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:44,047
I'll show you.

51
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:48,118
You have failed me for the last time.

52
00:03:48,153 --> 00:03:51,722
You are no longer my apprentice.

53
00:03:51,756 --> 00:03:55,859
And now you shall die.

54
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,136
Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan!

55
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:08,106
No, thank you.

56
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,841
No... thank you, artoo.

57
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,210
That's quite enough.

58
00:04:20,786 --> 00:04:23,456
Ventress, you're not looking well.

59
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,491
She never does.

60
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:26,726
You have failed, ventress.

61
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,060
Surrender.

62
00:04:28,095 --> 00:04:29,362
Never.

63
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:31,664
Ah!

64
00:04:45,747 --> 00:04:47,781
Whoosh!

65
00:04:48,816 --> 00:04:49,616
Whoosh!

66
00:04:53,254 --> 00:04:54,388
Yes, my lord.

67
00:04:54,422 --> 00:04:58,493
Ventress is battling the jed
on board the command ship.

68
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:02,196
Turn your guns on our
command ship and open fire.

69
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:07,235
But, my lord, I calculate that
will destroy ventress, the jedi,

70
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:09,036
and all our forces.

71
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:10,972
Precisely.

72
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,442
Ah!

73
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:19,481
Uh!

74
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:26,054
Yah!

75
00:05:27,323 --> 00:05:30,627
Ah!

76
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:32,295
We're in position.

77
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:33,897
Open fire.

78
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:57,288
Ah!

79
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,802
That is correct.

80
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:14,506
Calculate your flight path to
terminate in the main hangar.

81
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,712
It's over.

82
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,684
Anakin, look out!

83
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:30,857
We have to get out of here.

84
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,992
Abandon ship!

85
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,661
Abandon ship!

86
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:38,065
Abandon ship!

87
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:39,333
Abandon ship!

88
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:53,381
The command ship has been destroyed.

89
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:57,252
Our scanning indicates
there are no survivors.

90
00:06:57,286 --> 00:06:59,721
Your work there is finished.

91
00:06:59,755 --> 00:07:01,589
Recall the fleet.

92
00:07:01,624 --> 00:07:03,591
By your command.

93
00:07:18,278 --> 00:07:20,075
Master.

94
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,541
What is it, lord tyranus?

95
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:25,406
I have done as you've asked.

96
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,205
Asajj ventress is dead.

97
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:34,003
Once again, you've proven
your loyalty to me.

98
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:22,079
You took quite a beating there.

99
00:08:22,113 --> 00:08:23,844
Didn't you, missy?

100
00:08:26,078 --> 00:08:29,941
Which side of the battle was you on?

101
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,374
Aw.

102
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:33,340
Not too talkative, are you?

103
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,637
Take me to dathomir.

104
00:08:38,671 --> 00:08:41,469
Now, why would anyone
want to go there?

105
00:08:41,503 --> 00:08:44,400
Ain't nothing there
but fog and witches.

106
00:08:44,435 --> 00:08:46,566
Exactly.

107
00:08:46,601 --> 00:08:47,566
Whoosh!

108
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:47,803
We don't like strangers.

109
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,402
I'm not a stranger.

110
00:09:50,436 --> 00:09:52,100
Prepare to die.

111
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:54,400
Stop.

112
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:57,898
She is one of us.

113
00:09:57,933 --> 00:10:00,397
Take her to the village.

114
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:01,563
Who is she?

115
00:10:01,597 --> 00:10:03,262
What is she doing here?

116
00:10:03,297 --> 00:10:04,794
Shh. Quiet.

117
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:08,826
Mother...
Talzin.

118
00:10:28,684 --> 00:10:32,414
Bring the water of life.

119
00:10:53,838 --> 00:11:01,833
At last, you have returned,
and you are safe again.

120
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:08,563
I remember the day we were
forced to give you up

121
00:11:08,597 --> 00:11:11,729
to protect the clan.

122
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:18,925
Your sacrifice has
never been forgotten.

123
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:29,020
Master.

124
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:32,618
Master, where are you?

125
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:34,884
Master.

126
00:11:34,918 --> 00:11:37,682
They've killed you.

127
00:11:49,145 --> 00:11:49,976
Whoosh!

128
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,441
Ah!

129
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:57,572
You are strong with the
force, little one.

130
00:12:09,601 --> 00:12:16,530
Thank you, master.

131
00:12:16,564 --> 00:12:21,527
Thank you, master.

132
00:12:31,556 --> 00:12:35,754
Master!

133
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,419
Ah!

134
00:12:44,283 --> 00:12:45,648
Revenge.

135
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:48,347
I must have revenge.

136
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:53,778
I can sense the darkness within you.

137
00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:58,275
I will teach you the
ways of the dark side.

138
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,843
But you must prove yourself first.

139
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,637
Master, I need your help quickly.

140
00:13:08,672 --> 00:13:11,769
I've ordered your
reinforcements to return.

141
00:13:11,803 --> 00:13:14,568
No, I will destroy the jedi.

142
00:13:14,602 --> 00:13:16,034
I'll show you.

143
00:13:16,068 --> 00:13:19,932
You have failed me for the last time.

144
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:24,429
And now you shall die.

145
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:25,995
Dooku.

146
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,095
He betrayed me.

147
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:29,960
I know.

148
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:34,058
I had hoped you would find
your way to us sooner.

149
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:36,824
I will have revenge.

150
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:40,089
Yes, you shall, sister.

151
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:42,854
We will see to it.

152
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:48,684
Karis and naa'leth are the
greatest warriors of our coven.

153
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:51,483
I'll be the judge of that.

154
00:13:51,517 --> 00:13:55,943
They will help you
destroy count dooku.

155
00:13:58,482 --> 00:14:04,683
<i>Alnadee, mah, reez,
ven, doo, la, tren.</i>

156
00:14:04,717 --> 00:14:11,585
<i>Nadee, mah, reez, ven,
doo, la, tren.</i>

157
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:20,021
<i>Nadee, mah, reez, ven,
doo, la, tren.</i>

158
00:14:23,722 --> 00:14:25,589
Sister.

159
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:29,657
We have assembled a
potion for you to use

160
00:14:29,691 --> 00:14:36,125
in order to reach dooku's
palace undetected.

161
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:42,694
Step into the mist and
become like shadows.

162
00:14:54,798 --> 00:14:59,466
Now you are invisible to most.

163
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,966
Even count dooku?

164
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,200
Yes.

165
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:06,668
Perhaps even count dooku.

166
00:15:06,702 --> 00:15:09,068
What if he can sense us?

167
00:15:09,102 --> 00:15:12,203
Take this poison dart.

168
00:15:12,237 --> 00:15:17,938
It will dull his senses
and distort his vision.

169
00:15:17,972 --> 00:15:23,473
Then you can deal with him easily.

170
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:25,639
Jedi weapons.

171
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,707
You'll need these.

172
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:34,943
If the count engages you, he
must believe that you are jedi.

173
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:41,945
Naa'leth and karis,
serve your sister well.

174
00:15:41,979 --> 00:15:45,312
Deliver your vengeance, sister.

175
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:49,112
Then return to us.

176
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:52,447
We shall prevail.

177
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:53,898
This way.

178
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:58,233
He's below us.

179
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,701
You can sense him?

180
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:04,668
I can smell his stench a parsec away.

181
00:17:11,137 --> 00:17:13,271
Be on guard at all times.

182
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:15,505
He is no fool.

183
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:18,772
He is a sith lord.

184
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:34,477
Zip!

185
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,246
Ah.

186
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,046
What sorcery is this?

187
00:17:56,651 --> 00:18:01,651
I do not need my eyes
to see you, jedi.

188
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:31,226
Ah!

189
00:19:09,906 --> 00:19:12,338
Ah!

190
00:19:24,243 --> 00:19:24,975
Ah!

191
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:47,315
He is stronger than I imagined.

192
00:19:48,483 --> 00:19:51,316
I warned you.

193
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:17,257
Mother, we've...
We've failed.

194
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:24,359
Where one sees failure,
others see opportunity.

195
00:20:24,394 --> 00:20:26,927
What do you mean, mother?

196
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:32,828
Your infiltration proves
dooku is vulnerable.

197
00:20:32,863 --> 00:20:37,263
He will be eager to protect himself.

198
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:38,697
How?

199
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:43,565
By finding a replacement for you.

200
00:20:51,802 --> 00:20:53,467
Count dooku.

201
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,735
It has been too long.

202
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,602
Yes, mother talzin.

203
00:20:57,636 --> 00:20:59,603
How may I assist you?

204
00:20:59,637 --> 00:21:03,137
It has come to my attention
that you have lost your most

205
00:21:03,171 --> 00:21:05,138
prized assassin.

206
00:21:05,172 --> 00:21:07,805
How would you know of this?

207
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,073
I know these things.

208
00:21:11,107 --> 00:21:13,440
I have seen it.

209
00:21:13,474 --> 00:21:17,441
After all, she was once one of us.

210
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:21,842
It is true that your warriors are
of an extraordinary caliber.

211
00:21:21,877 --> 00:21:24,910
Perhaps something different this time.

212
00:21:24,945 --> 00:21:30,178
Perhaps a male from our planet
will be more to your liking,

213
00:21:30,212 --> 00:21:33,680
since you could not tame the female.

214
00:21:33,714 --> 00:21:37,647
I shall take you up on your offer.

215
00:21:37,682 --> 00:21:39,248
Excellent.

216
00:21:39,282 --> 00:21:42,115
I will be in contact.

217
00:21:44,617 --> 00:21:48,051
I will see count dooku dead.

218
00:21:48,085 --> 00:21:50,518
I swear it.

219
00:21:50,552 --> 00:21:53,052
So you shall.

220
00:21:53,086 --> 00:21:55,953
So you shall.
