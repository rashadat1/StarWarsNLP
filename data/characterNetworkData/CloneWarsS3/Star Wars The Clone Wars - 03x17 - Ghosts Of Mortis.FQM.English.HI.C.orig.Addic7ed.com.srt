00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:19,613
Male announcer: Stranded!

4
00:00:19,648 --> 00:00:20,915
Obi-Wan Kenobi,

5
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:22,016
Anakin Skywalker,

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,651
and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano

7
00:00:23,685 --> 00:00:24,752
are caught in the middle

8
00:00:24,786 --> 00:00:25,786
of a treacherous battle

9
00:00:25,821 --> 00:00:28,589
between good and evil.

10
00:00:28,623 --> 00:00:29,924
The scales now tipped

11
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,392
toward the dark side,

12
00:00:31,426 --> 00:00:32,893
our three warriors must guard

13
00:00:32,928 --> 00:00:33,661
against attack

14
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:35,663
as they plan their escape.

15
00:00:35,697 --> 00:00:37,331
A great weight has been placed

16
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:38,666
on Anakin's shoulders,

17
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,734
for it is now that he must face

18
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:43,170
who he really is.

19
00:00:51,313 --> 00:00:53,180
I'm getting a little tired

20
00:00:53,215 --> 00:00:54,081
of how unreliable

21
00:00:54,115 --> 00:00:55,349
the weather is here.

22
00:00:55,383 --> 00:00:56,350
Some might say

23
00:00:56,384 --> 00:00:57,918
that's part of the appeal.

24
00:00:57,953 --> 00:00:59,520
You did well, Anakin.

25
00:00:59,554 --> 00:01:01,088
How do you feel?

26
00:01:01,122 --> 00:01:02,623
I'm not sure we're doing

27
00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:04,291
the right thing by leaving.

28
00:01:04,326 --> 00:01:05,392
The son is consumed

29
00:01:05,427 --> 00:01:06,527
by the dark side.

30
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:08,128
And if we stay,

31
00:01:08,163 --> 00:01:09,129
we may be used

32
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:11,165
to the dark side's advantage.

33
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:12,566
Well,

34
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:14,134
you want the bad news...

35
00:01:14,169 --> 00:01:15,836
Or the really bad news?

36
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:17,137
Well, let's try

37
00:01:17,172 --> 00:01:18,138
the bad news,

38
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:19,940
laced with a little optimism.

39
00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:20,908
We've got two

40
00:01:20,942 --> 00:01:22,243
cracked shilo pins,

41
00:01:22,277 --> 00:01:23,978
a busted power converter,

42
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:25,479
the engines should be fired

43
00:01:25,513 --> 00:01:27,214
twice to dump debris,

44
00:01:27,249 --> 00:01:27,982
and the backup vents

45
00:01:28,016 --> 00:01:29,683
need charging.

46
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:32,152
Sounds terribly downbeat.

47
00:01:34,856 --> 00:01:36,423
Can it be fixed?

48
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,158
I can reroute

49
00:01:38,193 --> 00:01:39,493
the primary initiator,

50
00:01:39,527 --> 00:01:41,328
weld the dampening vents, and

51
00:01:41,363 --> 00:01:42,730
that might give us enough power

52
00:01:42,764 --> 00:01:44,164
to leave the atmosphere.

53
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:44,999
After that,

54
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:46,066
I have no guarantees

55
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:47,268
she'll hold together.

56
00:01:47,302 --> 00:01:48,736
We'll take our chances.

57
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,738
Better than staying here.

58
00:01:56,878 --> 00:01:58,679
Where are you going?

59
00:01:58,713 --> 00:02:00,080
To see the father.

60
00:02:00,115 --> 00:02:01,548
I'm not convinced that the son

61
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:02,349
will be contained here

62
00:02:02,384 --> 00:02:04,118
without our help.

63
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:05,753
Perhaps we should make a stand.

64
00:02:05,787 --> 00:02:06,620
Anakin...

65
00:02:06,655 --> 00:02:09,790
if I don't get the father's

66
00:02:09,824 --> 00:02:11,859
it'll haunt me forever.

67
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:47,561
> Forgive me, daughter.

68
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:49,797
I am an old fool

69
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:50,631
who believed

70
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:52,866
he could control the future.

71
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:56,971
Now you are gone...

72
00:02:57,005 --> 00:02:59,306
And all is lost.

73
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,712
Sleep well, my child.

74
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,050
Sleep free.

75
00:03:23,298 --> 00:03:25,599
You should have left by now.

76
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:27,368
Our ship needs repairs.

77
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:31,105
Do not underestimate my son.

78
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:32,673
He will seek your ship

79
00:03:32,707 --> 00:03:34,875
to escape our isolation and

80
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:38,445
sow terror through the universe.

81
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,781
And while you are here,

82
00:03:40,815 --> 00:03:43,350
he will use you to do it.

83
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:45,019
What will you do

84
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:46,353
now that he's given himself over

85
00:03:46,388 --> 00:03:47,721
to the dark side?

86
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:50,124
It is my actions

87
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:52,126
that have unleashed great danger

88
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,527
on the universe.

89
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:56,864
I must kill him.

90
00:03:56,898 --> 00:03:57,898
But he's too powerful

91
00:03:57,932 --> 00:03:59,033
for you alone.

92
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:01,235
Hmm, perhaps,

93
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:03,070
perhaps not.

94
00:04:03,104 --> 00:04:05,239
The force will decide.

95
00:04:05,273 --> 00:04:06,573
I can help you.

96
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:07,241
The choice

97
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:10,077
is no longer yours to make.

98
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:13,080
Both our destinies are clouded.

99
00:04:13,114 --> 00:04:15,082
This place

100
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:18,252
is strong with the force.

101
00:04:18,286 --> 00:04:21,422
Darkness has no hold here.

102
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:22,756
Go,

103
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:26,326
ask,

104
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,777
you have grown strong

105
00:04:43,812 --> 00:04:44,611
and powerful,

106
00:04:44,646 --> 00:04:46,713
just as I imagined.

107
00:04:46,748 --> 00:04:48,449
Master.

108
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:49,450
Do you believe

109
00:04:49,484 --> 00:04:51,251
you are the chosen one?

110
00:04:51,286 --> 00:04:53,620
How can I know?

111
00:04:53,655 --> 00:04:54,354
I can tell you

112
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:55,789
what I believe.

113
00:04:55,824 --> 00:04:56,957
I believe you will bring

114
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:58,792
balance to the force,

115
00:04:58,827 --> 00:05:01,995
that you will face your demons

116
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,063
and... and this creature

117
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:03,797
of the dark side?

118
00:05:03,832 --> 00:05:04,498
Do I leave,

119
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:06,066
or do I stay and kill him?

120
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:07,668
Neither.

121
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:09,736
Look deeper.

122
00:05:09,771 --> 00:05:12,005
You will find another way.

123
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,007
I don't understand.

124
00:05:14,042 --> 00:05:15,075
Not far from here,

125
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,543
there is a place which is strong

126
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:18,912
in the dark side of the force.

127
00:05:18,947 --> 00:05:22,082
You must go there.

128
00:05:22,117 --> 00:05:24,118
And destroy the son?

129
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:25,352
Remember your training,

130
00:05:25,386 --> 00:05:26,420
Anakin.

131
00:05:26,454 --> 00:05:28,822
Trust your instincts.

132
00:05:28,857 --> 00:05:30,057
Master.

133
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:32,059
Master!

134
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:45,539
Might I suggest less sleeping

135
00:05:45,573 --> 00:05:47,875
and a little more work?

136
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:50,177
Sorry, master Kenobi.

137
00:05:50,211 --> 00:05:51,378
Here.

138
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:53,780
This should help.

139
00:05:53,815 --> 00:05:56,116
We need to change plans.

140
00:05:56,151 --> 00:05:56,817
You must focus

141
00:05:56,851 --> 00:05:58,452
on the firing drives.

142
00:05:58,486 --> 00:05:59,620
Disengage them.

143
00:05:59,654 --> 00:06:00,988
But I'm almost finished

144
00:06:01,022 --> 00:06:01,989
putting this junk heap

145
00:06:02,023 --> 00:06:03,157
back together, and now...

146
00:06:03,191 --> 00:06:05,058
just do as I say.

147
00:06:05,093 --> 00:06:07,161
We don't have much time.

148
00:06:09,264 --> 00:06:11,365
Well, you're the boss.

149
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:16,036
Where's Anakin?

150
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,572
He came to me for guidance,

151
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:19,740
but at the crossroad,

152
00:06:19,774 --> 00:06:21,875
only he can choose.

153
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,178
The force will be his guide now.

154
00:06:24,212 --> 00:06:25,913
I don't like this.

155
00:06:25,947 --> 00:06:27,514
What have you done?

156
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:30,250
I have done nothing.

157
00:06:30,285 --> 00:06:32,085
I am merely letting the will

158
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,555
of the force take shape.

159
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:36,557
Where has he gone?

160
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:39,760
To the well of the dark side.

161
00:07:35,515 --> 00:07:37,516
Welcome.

162
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,018
I believe there has been

163
00:07:39,052 --> 00:07:41,120
a misunderstanding.

164
00:07:41,154 --> 00:07:42,354
We really don't

165
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:44,823
have to be enemies.

166
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:47,526
You murdered your sister.

167
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,361
The force is out of balance.

168
00:07:49,396 --> 00:07:50,996
I have to stop you.

169
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:53,465
Must you?

170
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,467
[Lightsaber hums]

171
00:07:57,337 --> 00:07:58,437
Anakin has gone to confront

172
00:07:58,505 --> 00:08:00,139
your son, hasn't he?

173
00:08:00,173 --> 00:08:03,976
Deep within this planet

174
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:07,079
all that is dark is channeled.

175
00:08:07,113 --> 00:08:08,781
And how do I get there?

176
00:08:08,815 --> 00:08:10,916
You cannot interfere.

177
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:12,551
The way I see it,

178
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:13,319
if we were not

179
00:08:13,353 --> 00:08:14,420
supposed to interfere,

180
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:15,821
Ahsoka and I wouldn't be here

[Both grunt]

359
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:12,824
What?

360
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,393
[Chuckles]

361
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,862
You're going to kill me now?

362
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,196
I held hope that you

363
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,999
could resist the dark side.

364
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,835
But I see now,

365
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,739
there is no going back.

366
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:28,673
Father.

[Grunts]

368
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,243
No!

369
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,678
What have you done?

370
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:36,882
It did not have to be this way.

371
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:41,353
Yes, my child, it did.

372
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:45,957
You and I are tied together,

373
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,627
runs through me.

374
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:53,432
This way, I take your power.

375
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,466
[Gasps]

376
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,803
Please, don't die.

377
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,971
I always knew

378
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:04,409
there was good in you.

379
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:05,944
[Lightsaber hums]

[Gasps and groans]

381
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,853
And so you have betrayed me,

382
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,589
father.

383
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,758
[Gasping]

384
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,468
It is done.

385
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:33,472
And now I die,

386
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:37,476
my heart broken,

387
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,979
the role you will play.

388
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,315
And what is that?

389
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:48,153
You are the chosen one.

390
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,822
You have brought balance

391
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,757
to this world.

392
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:56,328
Stay on this path,

393
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,130
and you will do it again

394
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,500
for the galaxy.

395
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:05,270
But beware your...

396
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,904
Heart.

397

401
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:02,894
General Skywalker, come in!

402
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,462
We read you, Rex.

403
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:05,497
Can you hear me?

404
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,165
Yes, sir, standing by.

405
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,300
We were worried.

406
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:10,168
You were off the scopes there

407
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,002
for a moment.

408
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:12,571
A moment?

409
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:13,338
We've been gone

410
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,706
more than a moment, Rex.

411
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,008
Sir, I don't understand.

412
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,276
You'll need to explain.

413
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:21,012
You wouldn't believe me

414
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:22,347
if I told you.

415
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,416
We're coming in now.
