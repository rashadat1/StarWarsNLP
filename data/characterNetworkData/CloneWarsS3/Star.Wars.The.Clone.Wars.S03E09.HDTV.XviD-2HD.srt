no!

345
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:39,074
[gunshot]

346
00:16:39,108 --> 00:16:41,076
Ah, what a world.

347
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:48,516
[engine whooshing]

348
00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:01,463
oh, I just hate it when

349
00:17:01,497 --> 00:17:04,733
Someone does my job.

350
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,167
and the holo-diary is gone

351
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:07,502
As well.

352
00:17:07,536 --> 00:17:09,471
oh, drat.

353
00:17:09,505 --> 00:17:10,872
[engine whirring]

354
00:17:10,907 --> 00:17:12,874
Jedi.

355
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:31,259
who could have done this?

356
00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:36,831
Bane.

357
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:37,899
looks like we're both too

358
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:39,634
Late for the party.

359
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:40,402
so this is not your

360
00:17:40,436 --> 00:17:41,770
Handiwork?

361
00:17:41,804 --> 00:17:44,039
no, I wouldn't have made such

362
00:17:44,073 --> 00:17:45,774
A sloppy kill.

363
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:47,175
Doesn't seem like much sense

364
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:48,677
Hanging around here

365
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:50,645
Or making any trouble between

366
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,947
Us.

367
00:17:51,981 --> 00:17:52,781
are you forgetting how you

368
00:17:52,815 --> 00:17:54,416
Held the senate hostage?

369
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,784
I may not be capturing Ziro,

370
00:17:55,818 --> 00:17:57,752
But you are going to prison.

371
00:17:57,787 --> 00:17:59,020
well, now that you mention

372
00:17:59,055 --> 00:18:01,690
It, the separatists are paying

373
00:18:01,724 --> 00:18:03,725
A million credits a head

374
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,094
For a jedi.

375
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:13,134
[blaster firing]

376
00:18:18,174 --> 00:18:20,141
ugh!

377
00:18:21,944 --> 00:18:23,912
[grunts]

378
00:18:40,463 --> 00:18:42,731
Ugh!

379
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:46,735
Ooh!

380
00:19:04,587 --> 00:19:06,554
[blaster firing]

381
00:19:15,431 --> 00:19:17,565
ugh!

382
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,667
ha ha ha!

383
00:19:23,773 --> 00:19:27,175
[moaning]

384
00:19:37,753 --> 00:19:39,721
ah!

385
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,379
[engine whooshing]

386
00:20:14,302 --> 00:20:16,732
I never did enjoy
hanging out with you.

387
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:28,402
[laughing maniacally]

388
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,810
Chuba inkabunga chik youngee.

389
00:20:35,844 --> 00:20:39,543
Jabba thanks you for
delivering the holo-diary.

390
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:41,616
No one would suspect that a

391
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,853
lovely creature such as myself

392
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:48,789
Could do a bounty hunter's work.

393

On a all new episode of
Star Wars the Clone Wars

395
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,826
Your friend is a succubus?

396
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:03,070
Asoka and Padme are going
behind enemy lines.

397
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,337
It's so good to see you.

398
00:21:05,457 --> 00:21:07,893
But who's going to be cleaning up
Corruscant while they're gone?

399
00:21:08,013 --> 00:21:10,420
I've deployed the infiltrators.

400
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,865
Oh, oh. That's not good.

401
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,342
Don't miss all new episode of
Star Wars the Clone Wars: Secrets Revealed.

- To peace then.
- To hope.
