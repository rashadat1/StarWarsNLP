00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,800
A separatist have launched
a massive offensive

4
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,400
against the planet Ryloth.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
A blockade of
deadly battleships

6
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:26,067
has cut off any support

7
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:28,136
for the dwindling
Republic defenses.

8
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:29,404
Though they have fought

9
00:00:29,438 --> 00:00:30,438
Valiantly with the help of

10
00:00:30,506 --> 00:00:31,673
Twi'lek freedom fighter

11
00:00:31,707 --> 00:00:34,876
Cham Syndulla,
hold his faith in jedi master

12
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,598
Di and his men as the droid

13
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:38,595
Army closes in.

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,102
Master jedi, we're running

15
00:01:03,136 --> 00:01:04,204
Out of food and water,

16
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:05,672
And our heavy weapon systems

17
00:01:05,706 --> 00:01:07,007
Are out of power.

18
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:08,309
I'll contact our forces

19
00:01:08,343 --> 00:01:09,543
In orbit.

20
00:01:09,577 --> 00:01:12,379
Admiral Dao, this is general Di.

21
00:01:12,414 --> 00:01:13,914
We're in trouble down here.

22
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:14,815
We need those supplies

23
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,486
Immediately.

24
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:19,288
I understand, general, but I

25
00:01:19,323 --> 00:01:21,391
Am in no position to help.

26
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:22,925
We are critically low on fuel

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,127
And ammunition.

28
00:01:24,195 --> 00:01:25,095
Contact the jedi

29
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:26,562
Council again!

30
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,997
Tell them reinforcements must be

31
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:31,271
Dispatched without delay!

32
00:01:36,213 --> 00:01:38,316
If help does not arrive soon,

33
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:39,686
The entire outer rim garrison

34
00:01:39,753 --> 00:01:40,921
Will be wiped out.

35
00:01:40,955 --> 00:01:41,823
Surely there must be

36
00:01:41,857 --> 00:01:42,491
Something you can do...

37
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:43,225
The main reactor's

38
00:01:43,293 --> 00:01:43,926
Been hit, sir.

39
00:01:43,961 --> 00:01:45,094
Systems are shutting down.

40
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:46,998
We are dead in space.

41
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:48,568
With regret, I report that

42
00:01:48,603 --> 00:01:49,837
My fleet will no longer be able

43
00:01:49,871 --> 00:01:50,938
To provide protection for the

44
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:52,640
Troops on Ryloth.

45
00:01:52,675 --> 00:01:54,009
I repeat my request that help

46
00:01:54,044 --> 00:01:55,646
Be sent right away.

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,647
The shields are gone.

48
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:58,951
We have no...

49
00:02:01,924 --> 00:02:03,491
Trapped on Ryloth

50
00:02:03,526 --> 00:02:10,367
Master Di and his men are.

51
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:11,035
My trade mission was

52
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:11,736
Successful,

53
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:13,204
Thank you for asking.

54
00:02:13,272 --> 00:02:14,474
But what's the matter?

55
00:02:14,508 --> 00:02:16,209
You all look very somber.

56
00:02:16,244 --> 00:02:17,579
Senator, the fleet

57
00:02:17,646 --> 00:02:19,180
Protecting Ryloth has been

58
00:02:19,215 --> 00:02:22,551
Destroyed, and the supply

59
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:23,753
The troops are out of food,

60
00:02:23,787 --> 00:02:25,855
Fuel, ammunition.

61
00:02:25,923 --> 00:02:27,291
And the civilian population

62
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:28,659
Is starving.

63
00:02:28,694 --> 00:02:30,394
That is grim news.

64
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:31,563
Our blockade runners should

65
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:32,498
Be able to penetrate the

66
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:33,632
Separatist lines and drop

67
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,467
Relief supplies.

68
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:36,935
But they do not have the range

69
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,303
To reach Ryloth.

70
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:40,205
The planet Toydaria is 2,000

71
00:02:40,273 --> 00:02:41,306
Parsecs closer than the

72
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:43,208
Nearest fleet.

73
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:44,176
If the blockade runners can

74
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,210
Supply from there, they might

75
00:02:45,278 --> 00:02:47,379
Reach Ryloth in time.

76
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:49,114
What would you have me do?

77
00:02:49,149 --> 00:02:50,015
We've dispatched a ship

78
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,384
Loaded with relief supplies to

79
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:52,986
Meet you on Toydaria.

80
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:54,187
You are a more experienced

81
00:02:54,222 --> 00:02:55,656
Diplomat than the representative

82
00:02:55,724 --> 00:02:57,493
From naboo who is already there.

83
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:58,761
Senator amidala is an

84
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:00,096
Excellent negotiator.

85
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:00,930
I am sure...

86
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:01,932
Senator amidala could not

87
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:03,534
Leave the senate.

88
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:05,203
Representative Binks

89
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,471
Accompanied the shipment.

90
00:03:06,538 --> 00:03:08,306
You must negotiate the treaty

91
00:03:08,374 --> 00:03:09,742
So that we can dispatch ships

92
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,177
From Toydaria and get Ryloth

93
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:13,112
The relief supplies it needs.

94
00:03:13,147 --> 00:03:15,281
I understand perfectly.

95
00:03:27,398 --> 00:03:30,000
This had better be important.

96
00:03:30,034 --> 00:03:32,102
Sir, we intercepted a coded

97
00:03:32,137 --> 00:03:33,471
Transmission between senator

98
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:35,740
Organa and the jedi council.

99
00:03:35,774 --> 00:03:36,841
We were able to partially

100
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:40,278
Unscramble it.

101
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:42,014
The jedi have sent senator

102
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:44,384
Organa to Toydaria to negotiate

103
00:03:44,452 --> 00:03:45,752
A treaty which would allow them

104
00:03:45,786 --> 00:03:46,987
To send relief supplies

105
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:49,356
To their forces on Ryloth.

106
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,090
Send a message

107
00:03:50,157 --> 00:03:51,358
To senator lott dod

108
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:52,826
Of the trade federation.

109
00:03:52,894 --> 00:03:54,461
I wish to speak with him

110
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:56,897
Immediately.

111
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:31,537
Stop where you are,

112
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,738
Offworlder.

113
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,006
We will provide you whatever

114
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:34,808
You need to continue

115
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:35,909
Your journey,

116
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:37,644
But you may not leave the ship.

117
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:39,346
I am senator bail Organa

118
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:41,082
Of the galactic republic.

119
00:04:41,117 --> 00:04:42,617
I come to speak with the high

120
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:44,620
Exalted king of Toydaria.

121
00:04:44,688 --> 00:04:46,789
Hi-Lo!

122
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:48,090
Let meesa through.

123
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,992
Meesa on a diplomatic mission.

124
00:04:50,027 --> 00:04:51,794
Senator Organa!

125
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:52,795
It's a pleasure to be

126
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,163
Seeing yousa.

127
00:04:54,197 --> 00:04:54,897
And you,

128
00:04:54,965 --> 00:04:56,499
Representative Binks.

129
00:04:56,534 --> 00:04:57,167
Shall we?

130
00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:58,534
Our laws of hospitality

131
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:00,604
Demand that we offer assistance,

132
00:05:00,638 --> 00:05:01,972
But this planet is closed

133
00:05:02,006 --> 00:05:03,073
To offworlders.

134
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:04,241
We are obliged to deliver

135
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:05,242
Our message to your king

136
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,777
In person.

137
00:05:06,811 --> 00:05:09,780
It won't take a minute.

138
00:05:18,256 --> 00:05:19,356
H-Lo?

139
00:05:19,424 --> 00:05:21,525
Yousa majesty?

140
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:24,528
Let me do the talking, okay?

141
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:33,136
State your business,

142
00:05:33,204 --> 00:05:34,805
Offworlders.

143
00:05:34,873 --> 00:05:35,972
Representative Binks

144
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,774
Of naboo.

145
00:05:37,842 --> 00:05:39,143
Senator bail Organa of

146
00:05:39,177 --> 00:05:40,511
Alderaan, sire.

147
00:05:40,578 --> 00:05:41,478
We have come to ask for

148
00:05:41,512 --> 00:05:42,479
Your help.

149
00:05:42,513 --> 00:05:43,714
Perhaps you failed to pay

150
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:44,681
Attention to the senate

151
00:05:44,715 --> 00:05:46,382
Orientation.

152
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:47,517
They should have explained that

153
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:50,219
Toydaria is a neutral system.

154
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:52,755
We are not part of the republic.

155
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:54,790
Yes, your majesty.

156
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:55,958
That is why we have come before

157
00:05:55,992 --> 00:05:57,859
You as friends.

158
00:05:57,894 --> 00:05:59,394
There is a humanitarian crisis

159
00:05:59,428 --> 00:06:00,495
On Ryloth.

160
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:02,129
Millions will be starvin' and

161
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:03,964
Dyin' without your help.

162
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:05,766
My esteemed colleague and I

163
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,935
Humbly beg that you allow us to

164
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:09,469
Use Toydaria as a staging

165
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:11,138
Ground to supply the planet

166
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,573
With relief aid.

167
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:16,777
Do not make your decision in

168
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,378
There are other factors

169
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:20,748
You might wish to consider.

170
00:06:34,156 --> 00:06:35,991
I believe you know lott dod,

171
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:37,526
Senator for the trade

172
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,627
Federation.

173
00:06:38,695 --> 00:06:40,930
Yes, we are acquainted.

174
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:41,798
Senator.

175
00:06:41,832 --> 00:06:43,066
Beggin' your highness,

176
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,002
<i>What'sa he doing here?</i>

177
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,637
Why shouldn't he be?

178
00:06:47,672 --> 00:06:48,905
Toydaria has an important

179
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,006
Contract with his

180
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,341
Trade federation.

181
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:52,543
The trade federation is too

182
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:54,078
Chummy with the separatists

183
00:06:54,112 --> 00:06:55,179
For my taste.

184
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:56,347
We have nothing to do with

185
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:58,149
The separatists!

186
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:00,252
Nute gunray is an extremist.

187
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:03,622
His views do not reflect those

188
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,091
Perhaps not.

189
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,091
The confusion.

190
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,093
We are only here to ensure

191
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,261
That nothing jeopardizes the

192
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:12,262
Agreement between Toydaria and

193
00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:13,630
The trade federation.

194
00:07:13,664 --> 00:07:15,365
Naboo and alderaan have

195
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,533
A long tradition of providing

196
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:18,067
Humanitarian aid.

197
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:20,336
I see no reason for conflict.

198
00:07:20,404 --> 00:07:21,337
Nor do I.

199
00:07:21,405 --> 00:07:22,505
The people of Ryloth

200
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:23,773
Are suffering,

201
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:25,609
And compassion is a sacred

202
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:27,344
Toydarian value.

203
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,979
Honesty is also a toydarian

204
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:31,814
Value, is it not?

205
00:07:31,882 --> 00:07:35,485
I'm sure the senator mentioned

206
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,153
Around Ryloth.

207
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:39,055
A blockade?

208
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:39,989
Is this true?

209
00:07:42,426 --> 00:07:44,428
Yes, your majesty.

210
00:07:44,462 --> 00:07:46,497
But it changes nothing.

211
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:48,332
Inconceivable!

212
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:52,970
It changes everything.

213
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:54,672
Help the republic, it will

214
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,941
Destroy our neutrality.

215
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,244
I must convene my ministers,

216
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,212
Then we shall hear

217
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,414
Your arguments.

218
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:35,046
General Di, the right flank

219
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,114
Has collapsed.

220
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:36,948
The droids will be closing in

221
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,116
On our position.

222
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,118
What about reinforcements?

223
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:40,819
Communication has

224
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,187
Been spotty.

225
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,387
I promise you, cham,

226
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:44,021
The republic

227
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,123
Will not abandon Ryloth.

228
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:46,924
I've heard enough of your

229
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,225
Promises, jedi.

230
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:50,027
The fact remains: If we stay

231
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:51,295
Here without reinforcements,

232
00:08:51,362 --> 00:08:53,630
We're all going to die.

233
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:54,998
Gobi, tell the people

234
00:08:55,032 --> 00:08:56,199
We're leaving.

235
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:57,266
Yes, sir.

236
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:58,000
I don't think you

237
00:08:58,035 --> 00:08:58,768
Understand.

238
00:08:58,836 --> 00:09:00,903
The right flank has collapsed.

239
00:09:00,937 --> 00:09:01,670
There's no leaving.

240
00:09:01,738 --> 00:09:03,906
We're stuck here together.

241
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:07,844
We will now hear arguments

242
00:09:07,911 --> 00:09:08,911
In the matter of using

243
00:09:08,946 --> 00:09:11,081
Toydarian territory to aid the

244
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:12,749
Shipment of relief supplies to

245
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:15,620
The citizens of Ryloth.

246
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:16,854
Senator Organa.

247
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:18,923
Thank you, your majesty.

248
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,560
The operation the republic

249
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,395
Humanitarian.

250
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:24,530
We wish to deliver food and

251
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,264
Medical supplies to the people

252
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,566
Of Ryloth.

253
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:28,901
But if you won't listen to me,

254
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,303
Wise king, listen to senator

255
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,806
Orn free taa of Ryloth, who is

256
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,474
Well aware of the suffering of

257
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,109
His people.

258
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,712
Your highness, our cities

259
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:42,081
Lie in ruins.

260
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:43,984
Our transportation hubs are all

261
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:46,553
But destroyed, so I cannot

262
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,455
Return home.

263
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:50,457
Our crops burn.

264
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:53,828
The twi'lek people are starving.

265
00:09:53,862 --> 00:09:56,364
And they will die if no aid

266
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,199
Comes to them.

267
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:03,104
I appeal to you, great king.

268
00:10:03,172 --> 00:10:04,272
This is a crisis of

269
00:10:04,307 --> 00:10:05,373
Planetary proportions.

270
00:10:05,441 --> 00:10:06,507
We cannot let them starve.

271
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,908
The basic tenets of our

272
00:10:07,943 --> 00:10:09,810
Morality and even our

273
00:10:09,878 --> 00:10:11,245
Constitution demand that we

274
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,179
Help those in need.

275
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:15,915
Those ideals are noble, but

276
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,617
We must be careful that our

277
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:19,185
Compassion does not draw us

278
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,453
Into this war.

279
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:22,888
Senator dod, if you please.

280
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,725
Great king, senator Organa

281
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,094
Is deceiving you.

282
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:29,963
The inconvenient fact remains

283
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:33,333
That this is a war, and Ryloth

284
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35,168
Is a battlefield.

285
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,337
The planet is under a separatist

286
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,239
Blockade because jedi knights

287
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:40,540
And clone soldiers

288
00:10:40,608 --> 00:10:42,809
Are battling the droid army

289
00:10:42,844 --> 00:10:44,811
For control of the surface.

290
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,146
This will not be

291
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,881
A humanitarian base.

292
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:50,150
It will be a military base.

293
00:10:50,185 --> 00:10:51,985
The separatist senate will see

294
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,153
It as a violation of your

295
00:10:53,188 --> 00:10:54,622
Neutrality.

296
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:57,157
That in turn will expose the

297
00:10:57,192 --> 00:10:58,759
Trade federation's ships to

298
00:10:58,794 --> 00:11:00,795
Attacks from the separatists

299
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:02,430
And force us to cease trade

300
00:11:02,464 --> 00:11:05,166
With Toydaria, a situation

301
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:07,435
Desirable to no one.

302
00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:09,504
We cannot...

303
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:10,338
How it might effect

304
00:11:10,373 --> 00:11:11,072
Our economy.

305
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:14,777
Your majesty, the people of

306
00:11:14,811 --> 00:11:16,245
Ryloth did not ask

307
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,513
To be invaded.

308
00:11:17,548 --> 00:11:19,382
Do not let them suffer because

309
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,784
War came to them.

310
00:11:20,818 --> 00:11:22,219
I sympathize with the plight

311
00:11:22,253 --> 00:11:23,586
Of the twi'leks.

312
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,488
But this is not about saving

313
00:11:25,522 --> 00:11:26,956
Them when they are fighting

314
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,791
Against the separatists.

315
00:11:28,825 --> 00:11:31,060
Thank you, senators.

316
00:11:31,127 --> 00:11:32,127
You have given us much

317
00:11:32,162 --> 00:11:34,396
To consider.

318
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,697
I will summon you once I have

319
00:11:35,764 --> 00:11:40,134
Made my decision.

320
00:11:40,202 --> 00:11:40,835
Come on.

321
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,773
Hurry, hurry!

322
00:11:44,808 --> 00:11:46,208
Captain,

323
00:11:46,242 --> 00:11:47,476
Is the gunship ready?

324
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,578
Yes, sir.

325
00:11:48,612 --> 00:11:49,946
But it's too small to evacuate

326
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,213
The refugees.

327
00:11:51,248 --> 00:11:52,649
No escape?

328
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:54,484
But our families are with us.

329
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,221
If we reconfigure the fuel

330
00:11:57,288 --> 00:11:59,022
System, we can turn the ship

331
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,658
Into a bomb big enough to

332
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:02,960
Collapse the pass here.

333
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:04,762
The enemy will then only be

334
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,931
Able to engage us on one front

335
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:09,134
From this ravine.

336
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:11,003
While we provide cover,

337
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:12,471
The twi'leks will have time to

338
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:14,307
Escape with their families over

339
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,308
The mountain.

340
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:17,911
Brilliant strategy, general.

341
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,480
I'll go tell the men.

342
00:12:23,851 --> 00:12:26,185
After considerable debate,

343
00:12:26,219 --> 00:12:28,287
I have made my decision.

344
00:12:28,355 --> 00:12:30,756
I am sorry, senator Organa.

345
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,624
But for the sake of my people,

346
00:12:32,658 --> 00:12:37,095
Toydaria must remain neutral.

347
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:40,665
A wise ruling, your majesty.

348
00:12:47,374 --> 00:12:49,375
That did not go well.

349
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:51,845
What are weesa gonna do now?

350
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:56,483
My friends.

351
00:12:56,551 --> 00:12:58,352
Toydaria cannot turn a blind eye

352
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:00,387
To the suffering of Ryloth.

353
00:13:00,422 --> 00:13:02,023
The twi'leks are innocent

354
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:03,657
Victims caught between the

355
00:13:03,691 --> 00:13:05,092
Warring factions through

356
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,460
No fault of their own.

357
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,728
I'm glad you agree,

358
00:13:07,763 --> 00:13:08,930
Your highness.

359
00:13:08,964 --> 00:13:10,331
What are you prepared to do?

360
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:12,099
You may use Toydaria

361
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,200
To transfer the supplies

362
00:13:13,268 --> 00:13:15,702
You brought with you.

363
00:13:15,737 --> 00:13:17,471
One, maybe two rotations.

364
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:19,106
It will have to do.

365
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:21,275
And you must guarantee that the

366
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:22,742
Trade federation will not be

367
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,010
Able to link Toydaria to

368
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:25,612
The mission.

369
00:13:25,646 --> 00:13:26,912
Agreed.

370
00:13:26,947 --> 00:13:29,248
I have an idea.

371
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:38,197
I'll signal you when the

372
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:40,566
Ships are ready to depart.

373
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
Meesa won't let you

374
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:43,035
Down, senator.

375
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:51,142
We're pleased

376
00:13:51,176 --> 00:13:53,011
You could join us, senator.

377
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:54,112
Your majesty.

378
00:13:54,146 --> 00:13:56,048
The pleasure is mine.

379
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:57,116
Formal dinners are

380
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:59,385
So tedious.

381
00:13:59,453 --> 00:14:01,121
I am afraid that pressing

382
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:02,222
Matters require me to make

383
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,291
Immediate contact

384
00:14:04,325 --> 00:14:05,559
But I leave you in the capable

385
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:06,760
Hands of my colleague,

386
00:14:06,795 --> 00:14:10,031
Representative Binks.

387
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,209
General, we're loading the

388
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,310
Rest of the explosives onto

389
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:22,211
The gunship.

390
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:23,478
Very good, captain.

391
00:14:23,513 --> 00:14:24,947
Ready the men.

392
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:25,648
All units:

393
00:14:25,682 --> 00:14:27,550
Prepare for attack!

394
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:28,650
We won't be able to hold off

395
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:30,652
The droids for long.

396
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:31,854
You'll have to move quickly to

397
00:14:31,888 --> 00:14:32,755
Get your families

398
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,657
Out of danger.

399
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:39,830
Cham is still angry.

400
00:14:39,864 --> 00:14:41,799
He feels betrayed.

401
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,000
We counted on republic

402
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:46,304
Assistance, and it didn't come.

403
00:14:46,338 --> 00:14:49,641
War turns promises into hopes.

404
00:14:49,676 --> 00:14:51,644
I wish it wasn't so.

405
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:53,111
Tell him.

406
00:14:53,146 --> 00:14:55,914
I will.

407
00:15:02,921 --> 00:15:04,555
Captain keeli, tell the

408
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,823
Pilots to move the gunship

409
00:15:05,891 --> 00:15:07,525
Into position.

410
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,659
This is command.

411
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:11,295
Are all the charges in place?

412
00:15:11,363 --> 00:15:11,995
Copy that.

413
00:15:12,063 --> 00:15:12,830
We're all ready.

414
00:15:12,898 --> 00:15:14,098
The droid army is closing.

415
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:15,733
As soon as they're in range,

416
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:18,269
Blow up the gunship.

417
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:24,644
There is a gunship

418
00:15:24,678 --> 00:15:26,012
Blocking our way.

419
00:15:26,046 --> 00:15:32,186
Om-5, om-7, go check it out.

420
00:15:37,492 --> 00:15:39,326
Careful, it might be full

421
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,095
Of clones.

422
00:15:42,163 --> 00:15:43,730
Uh, no clones.

423
00:15:43,765 --> 00:15:45,265
Just explosives.

424
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,699
Explosives?

425
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:47,333
Gotcha.

426
00:15:47,368 --> 00:15:48,001
Beep!

427
00:16:03,418 --> 00:16:04,986
Halt, halt!

428
00:16:05,053 --> 00:16:06,721
We cannot get through.

429
00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:07,789
We will have to find another

430
00:16:07,857 --> 00:16:09,624
Way around.

431
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:26,709
Move those supplies into the

432
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:30,512
Transport as soon as possible.

433
00:16:37,721 --> 00:16:39,589
Repeat, the ships are ready

434
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:43,159
To launch.

435
00:16:44,695 --> 00:16:50,434
Uh, lookie, lookie!

436
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:53,137
Meesa proposing a conceptual

437
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:55,406
Ambassador of trade federation.

438
00:16:55,441 --> 00:16:56,608
Uh, let's see.

439
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:58,310
I'll take that one.

440
00:17:04,952 --> 00:17:05,952
Yeah, just give me.

441
00:17:05,987 --> 00:17:06,920
Are you done with that?

442
00:17:06,955 --> 00:17:07,855
That's really good.

443
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:09,557
I heard toydarians really like

444
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:10,925
That, but I'm taking it.

445
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,026
Thank you very much.

446
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:12,760
I'm sure you're finished

447
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:13,460
With that.

448
00:17:13,495 --> 00:17:14,662
Did you enjoy that?

449
00:17:14,696 --> 00:17:15,463
Did you like that one?

450
00:17:15,497 --> 00:17:16,697
Well, I'll take it, thank you.

451
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:19,567
Excuse me.

452
00:17:19,601 --> 00:17:20,868
Thank you.

453
00:17:20,936 --> 00:17:22,670
I'll take that.

454
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:27,641
Gentlemen and gentlemen.

455
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:28,776
Here's a try this one.

456
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,946
Ah, you thought I was going

457
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:36,684
To drop...

458
00:17:36,718 --> 00:17:38,852
I, here we go.

459
00:17:53,735 --> 00:17:54,834
I'm spinning it.

460
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:57,738
One, two, three!

461
00:17:57,806 --> 00:17:59,473
There is conceptual art piece.

462
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,842
Thank you.

463
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,912
Meesa just sharing my gungan art

464
00:18:04,946 --> 00:18:07,281
With yousa and...

465
00:18:09,851 --> 00:18:11,485
And meesa.

466
00:18:11,553 --> 00:18:13,353
What are you looking at?

467
00:18:13,387 --> 00:18:15,388
Meesa look at nothing!

468
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,022
At nothing.

469
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,558
Meesa creating and sharing

470
00:18:19,626 --> 00:18:21,660
Gungan ritual style art

471
00:18:21,728 --> 00:18:24,262
With trade federation...

472
00:18:26,598 --> 00:18:28,166
To promote love

473
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,634
And understanding.

474
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,174
Steady.

475
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,174
Remember, we have to buy as

476
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,709
Much time for the twi'leks as

477
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:40,544
Possible.

478
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:42,379
Yes, sir.

479
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:45,815
For the republic!

480
00:18:45,883 --> 00:18:47,184
For the twi'leks!

481
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:39,671
I'm not finished yet, sir.

482
00:19:39,706 --> 00:19:40,973
We can do this, general.

483
00:19:44,143 --> 00:19:46,311
Well, let's make the end

484
00:19:46,345 --> 00:19:48,046
Memorable.

485
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:55,586
This is republic blockade

486
00:19:55,621 --> 00:19:57,221
Runner oh-Niner-Niner.

487
00:19:57,289 --> 00:19:59,323
We have broken through.

488
00:19:59,391 --> 00:20:01,325
The twi'leks will live to

489
00:20:01,393 --> 00:20:03,127
Fight another day.

490
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,967
The supplies have arrived at

491
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:15,605
The drop point.

492
00:20:28,486 --> 00:20:29,653
It's food and medical

493
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,121
Supplies from the republic.

494
00:20:41,332 --> 00:20:43,500
Safe journey, my friends.

495
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:45,835
I hope when we meet again it is

496
00:20:45,903 --> 00:20:46,669
Under more pleasant

497
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:47,770
Circumstances.

498
00:20:47,838 --> 00:20:52,942
Stop right there.

499
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,377
You look pale, senator.

500
00:20:54,444 --> 00:20:55,644
I have just received

501
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,845
Information that a fleet of

502
00:20:56,913 --> 00:20:58,747
Republic ships has penetrated

503
00:20:58,782 --> 00:21:01,483
The blockade around Ryloth.

504
00:21:01,518 --> 00:21:02,651
If the trade federation has

505
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,487
Proof of any treaty violation,

506
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,722
You're welcome to present it to

507
00:21:06,757 --> 00:21:08,124
The full senate.

508
00:21:08,192 --> 00:21:09,559
It takes years for the

509
00:21:09,593 --> 00:21:11,294
Senate to decide anything.

510
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,974
You play a dangerous game,

511
00:21:24,008 --> 00:21:25,342
Organa.

512
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,910
Next time, you will not get

513
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:29,546
Away with this.

514
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:30,715
The republic has heart,

515
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:32,350
My friend.

516
00:21:32,384 --> 00:21:33,651
But I am not convinced it has

517
00:21:33,685 --> 00:21:36,254
The strength to prevail.

518
00:21:36,288 --> 00:21:38,156
However, after what I witnessed

519
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,291
Here today, perhaps it is time

520
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:42,994
I reconsidered our neutrality.

521
00:21:43,028 --> 00:21:44,629
Tell the jedi I am open to

522
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:45,997
Meeting with them.

523
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:47,599
Master Yoda will be glad to

524
00:21:47,633 --> 00:21:48,800
Hear it.

525
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:50,001
For now, at least,

526
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:51,536
The people of Ryloth

527
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,806
Shall endure.
