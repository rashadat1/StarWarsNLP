16
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:11,365
Thank you for receiving me, sister.

17
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:15,642
I believe the old alliance can
again be what it once was.

18
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:19,017
You would only have to pledge
your clan's allegiance to the

19
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:21,456
separatists' cause.

20
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,363
We could certainly use the
powers of the Nightsisters

00:01:24,397 --> 00:01:26,434
against the jedi.

22
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:30,111
Such a generous offer, count.

23
00:01:30,145 --> 00:01:35,624
But our loyalty is reserved
for only each other.

24
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:39,099
The only reason I am aiding
in your search for a new

25
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:45,113
assassin is because long
ago, you chose to help me.

26
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:49,391
After this matter is resolved,
I hope our paths never

27

You have heard of the sith warrior
darth maul, have you not?

35
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:31,393
Yes, he was slain on Naboo at
the hand of Obi-Wan Kenobi.

36
00:02:31,428 --> 00:02:36,640
A few still remain in his bloodline.

37
00:02:36,674 --> 00:02:41,352
The men dwell on the
far side of Dathomir.

38
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:46,197
What if I could provide
another of his kind?

39
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:49,104
A warrior of the same caliber?

40
00:02:49,138 --> 00:02:52,846
Yes, but I warn you.

Men are easy to acquire,
hard to control.

Asajj Ventress, dead

and the jedi's attacks
against me increasing.

44
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:10,389
Procuring a new
personal assassin is essential.

45
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,226
Very well.

46
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:15,969
It shall be done, my Lord.

another apprentice...

A barbarian, no less.

50
00:03:32,376 --> 00:03:36,987
A man we deliver to the count
with all of the training and skill

51
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:39,861
an assassin can possess.

52
00:03:39,895 --> 00:03:43,469
This warrior must have
no loyalty to Dooku.

53
00:03:43,504 --> 00:03:47,479
He will be our pawn.

54

Yes, yes.

55
00:03:50,555 --> 00:03:55,231
We will use our magicks to
manipulate his assassin,

56
00:03:55,266 --> 00:04:00,678
and when the time is right...
Dooku will pay for his

57

betrayal with his life.

58
00:04:04,422 --> 00:04:09,767
You will go to the far side
of Dathomir and find the men.

You will select the most

we can use to our advantage.

He is ready, sisters.

171
00:15:10,503 --> 00:15:15,278
Look at the strength
in him, the power!

172
00:15:23,226 --> 00:15:26,198
[Groaning]

173
00:15:33,177 --> 00:15:35,681
Let me go!

174
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:38,419
Calmly, sister.

175
00:15:38,453 --> 00:15:42,994
Let me go.

176
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:49,439
[Grunting and gasping]

177
00:15:52,045 --> 00:15:56,184
That's better.

178
00:15:56,218 --> 00:15:59,056
Bring in the prisoner.

179
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,729
Now for the final test.

180
00:16:10,477 --> 00:16:13,482
Savage?

181
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:17,255
Kill him.

182
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,494
Savage, you know me.

183
00:16:20,528 --> 00:16:22,598
I am your kin.

184
00:16:22,632 --> 00:16:25,303
Do not do this.

185
00:16:25,337 --> 00:16:25,970
Whack!

186
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:29,945
I said kill him.

187
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:31,447
No!

188
00:16:31,482 --> 00:16:34,953
Brother! Brother, please!

189
00:16:34,987 --> 00:16:37,959
You beg?

190
00:16:37,993 --> 00:16:41,331
Weakling!

191
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:44,404
Savage!

192
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:46,708
[Bones crunch]

193
00:16:49,347 --> 00:16:52,217
Good.

194
00:16:52,252 --> 00:16:56,124
You will learn to draw your
strength from your emotions.

195
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:58,562
Hate will feed you.

196
00:16:58,596 --> 00:17:03,738
Never sympathize with the
enemy, not even for a moment.

197
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,576
Yes, sister.

198
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,613
[Whooshing]

199
00:17:08,648 --> 00:17:14,723
For you, an enchanted
blade, blessed with our

200
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:17,896
most potent magicks.

201
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:23,740
I think it's time we introduce the
apprentice to his new master.

202
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:26,745
Wouldn't you agree?

203
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:31,454
[Engine whooshing]

204
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:45,913
At last.

205
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:58,702
Sister.

206
00:17:58,737 --> 00:18:01,274
Count Dooku.

207
00:18:01,308 --> 00:18:07,418
May I present Savage Opress.

208
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:10,423
[Thumping footsteps]

209
00:18:21,611 --> 00:18:23,680
[Rock crumbles]

210
00:18:23,714 --> 00:18:28,322
He certainly is a sight to behold.

211
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:31,861
The fiercest of his kind, my Lord.

212
00:18:31,896 --> 00:18:35,033
He shall serve you well.

213
00:18:35,068 --> 00:18:38,039
Yes, he shall.

214
00:18:46,755 --> 00:18:51,263
Mother Talzin speaks very
highly of your skills.

215
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:56,605
Still, I require proof of
your abilities as a warrior.

216
00:18:59,077 --> 00:19:02,181
The jedi are in control
of a vital outpost on the

217
00:19:02,216 --> 00:19:05,755
jungle planet of Devaron, a temple.

218
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:07,392
A temple?

219
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:09,728
Do not be fooled, Savage.

220
00:19:09,763 --> 00:19:13,803
The temple of eedit serves
only as a front for the mility

221
00:19:13,837 --> 00:19:16,374
operations of the Republic.

222
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:20,281
It is essential that we seize
the temple if the separatists

223
00:19:20,316 --> 00:19:24,121
ever hope to take control of
that corner of the galaxy.

224
00:19:24,156 --> 00:19:29,764
You shall go to Devaron and
take what is rightfully ours.

225
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:32,903
Yes, my Lord.

226
00:19:32,937 --> 00:19:35,675
[Engine humming]

227
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,121
[Blasters firing]

228
00:20:00,787 --> 00:20:03,491
[Metal clanging]

229
00:20:03,525 --> 00:20:07,832
Get him!

230
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:10,837
[Lightsabers humming]

231
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:16,414
Jedi.

232
00:20:19,487 --> 00:20:20,321
Master?

233
00:20:20,356 --> 00:20:21,489
Stay back!

234
00:20:21,524 --> 00:20:24,027
[Lightsabers humming]

235
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:33,445
[Grunting]

236
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:36,216
No!

237
00:20:48,338 --> 00:20:50,007
My Lord.

238
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:51,510
Is it finished?

239
00:20:51,544 --> 00:20:52,745
Yes.

240
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,916
The temple has been taken.

241
00:20:54,951 --> 00:20:56,652
And the jedi?

242
00:20:56,687 --> 00:20:57,688
Dead.

243
00:20:57,722 --> 00:21:00,659
Very impressive, Savage.

244
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:03,798
Return to Serenno immediately.

245
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:06,804
Very well, my Lord.

246
00:21:13,483 --> 00:21:16,220
You have done well, Savage.

247
00:21:16,255 --> 00:21:19,693
I'll have much use for you.

248
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:23,133
Thank you, my Lord.

249
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:27,607
I foresee we will do
great things together.

250
00:21:27,642 --> 00:21:31,748
I shall teach you the
ways of the dark side.

251
00:21:31,782 --> 00:21:36,590
Soon your powers will rival
that of the great sith Lord

252
00:21:36,624 --> 00:21:38,259
Darth Maul.

253
00:21:38,294 --> 00:21:44,537
We will be even more
powerful than Lord Sidious.

254
00:21:44,572 --> 00:21:50,515
We shall rule the galaxy
together, my apprentice.

255
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:56,024
I am your servant, Master.
