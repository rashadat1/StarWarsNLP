1
00:00:16,326 --> 00:00:18,227
<i>Clone troopers unite!</i>

2
00:00:18,261 --> 00:00:20,829
<i>As war rages across the galaxy,</i>

3
00:00:20,863 --> 00:00:22,164
<i>The republic's clone army</i>

4
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:23,765
<i>Strives for victory against the</i>

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,468
<i>Evil forces of the separatists.</i>

6
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:28,971
<i>Bravery, valor, unity:</i>

7
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:30,706
<i>The lifeblood of victory on the</i>

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,108
<i>Battlefield and in space.</i>

9
00:00:33,142 --> 00:00:34,977
<i>It all begins on the planet</i>

10
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:36,545
<i>Kamino, where jedi general</i>

11
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:38,580
<i>Shaak Ti oversees the training</i>

12
00:00:38,615 --> 00:00:40,015
<i>Of clones with the help of</i>

13
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:42,417
<i>Contracted bounty hunters.</i>

14
00:00:42,452 --> 00:00:44,253
<i>Bred to be perfect soldiers,</i>

15
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:45,654
<i>These cadets must first be</i>

16
00:00:45,688 --> 00:00:47,256
<i>Subjected to intense physical</i>

17
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,724
<i>And mental training before</i>

18
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:50,726
<i>Heading off to war...</i>

19
00:01:05,742 --> 00:01:08,043
You're clear.
You're clear!

20
00:01:08,077 --> 00:01:10,412
Cover fire!

21
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,784
<i>This is command:</i>

22
00:01:15,818 --> 00:01:16,885
<i>You must break through enemy</i>

23
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:18,954
<i>Lines and take the tower.</i>

24
00:01:18,988 --> 00:01:20,456
Comlink just relayed
orders from...

25
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:22,124
We all had the orders, Echo!

26
00:01:22,158 --> 00:01:23,191
Stop calling me that.

27
00:01:23,226 --> 00:01:24,960
Stop repeating every order.

28
00:01:24,994 --> 00:01:27,562
Less yappin'; more blastin'.

29
00:01:29,932 --> 00:01:31,066
Let's smoke these chrome domes

30
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,168
And move on to the citadel.

31
00:01:33,202 --> 00:01:34,169
CT-782,

32
00:01:34,203 --> 00:01:36,138
You're breaking formation.

33
00:01:36,172 --> 00:01:38,707
Just follow my lead, will ya?

34
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:43,145
He's clearing a path.

35
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:45,747
I'm moving.

36
00:01:48,518 --> 00:01:50,652
Thanks, CT-27-5555.

37
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:51,720
That was close.

38
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:52,721
It's fives.

39
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:55,791
The name is "fives."

40
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:57,225
Yeah, Five pieces if you

41
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,061
Don't keep your head down!

42
00:01:59,095 --> 00:02:00,929
How about we follow orders?

43
00:02:00,963 --> 00:02:02,497
This is our last practice test.

44
00:02:02,532 --> 00:02:03,498
Will you shut up with

45
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:04,633
Instructions?

46
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:06,868
You're not in charge.

47
00:02:09,906 --> 00:02:11,406
This particular unit seems

48
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:12,808
To have some trouble.

49
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:14,543
What do you recommend?

50
00:02:14,577 --> 00:02:16,778
Well, I'm no jedi, so forgive

51
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:18,647
My bluntness, but I say they

52
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:19,548
Fail.

53
00:02:19,582 --> 00:02:20,682
Send 'em down to maintenance

54
00:02:20,717 --> 00:02:22,551
Duty with 99 and the other

55
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:23,752
Rejects.

56
00:02:23,786 --> 00:02:25,087
We can't fail them yet.

57
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:26,121
Remember, this is only a

58
00:02:26,155 --> 00:02:27,255
Practice test.

59
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,157
And besides, the citadel course

60
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:30,092
Was constructed to be a

61
00:02:30,126 --> 00:02:32,060
Difficult challenge.

62
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:33,395
Although I don't agree with

63
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:36,631
His sentiment, bric isn't wrong.

64
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,368
These cadets are far from ready.

65
00:02:41,304 --> 00:02:42,904
I can't hit anything from

66
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:44,306
Here.

67
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,441
No, we have to follow orders.

68
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:49,411
The one they call "Echo"

69
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:52,013
Never adapts to the situation.

70
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:00,856
CT-782 seems to follow his

71
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,090
Own path.

72
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,059
He can't do it all alone.

73
00:03:04,093 --> 00:03:06,395
You go; I'll cover you.

74
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:08,063
I'm a better shot. You go.

75
00:03:08,097 --> 00:03:11,233
No, you go!

76
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:15,771
Look at those two.

77
00:03:15,805 --> 00:03:17,105
End up dead.

78
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,741
Uh, and the last one...

79
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:26,782
I surrender. I surrender.

80
00:03:26,816 --> 00:03:28,817
Need I say more?

81
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:29,818
If these cadets can't get

82
00:03:29,852 --> 00:03:30,852
Past their shortsighted

83
00:03:30,887 --> 00:03:32,921
Selfishness, they will never

84
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:34,723
Come together.

85
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:37,125
Unity wins war, gentlemen.

86
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,960
Computer, end exercise for

87
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:41,396
Domino squad.

88
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:43,131
99, would you please send a

89
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,633
Cleaning crew to the training

90
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:47,169
Ground?

91
00:03:47,203 --> 00:03:49,771
We'll take care of the mess.

92
00:03:49,806 --> 00:03:51,206
You should tell that 99 to

93
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,041
Drag away the mess called

94
00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:56,011
Domino squad.

95
00:03:58,648 --> 00:04:01,316
We almost had it this time.

96
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,350
Oh, yeah, and we all look

97
00:04:02,385 --> 00:04:03,718
Nothing alike either.

98
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:05,954
Sorry about the mess, 99.

99
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:07,856
Uh, it's okay, boys.

100
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,192
Nice try.

101
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:14,663
So I says to her, "baby,

102
00:04:14,697 --> 00:04:16,331
You and me could really"...

103
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:20,669
You've never even met a girl.

104
00:04:20,703 --> 00:04:21,903
You know, you shouldn't

105
00:04:21,938 --> 00:04:25,040
Worry because most clones pass.

106
00:04:25,074 --> 00:04:26,241
Yeah, but not all of us,

107
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:29,644
Right, shortie?

108
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:33,281
Guys, we've got to follow

109
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:33,949
Orders.

110
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:35,150
Come on.

111
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:36,384
I don't know.

112
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:37,752
I think it went rather well.

113
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:39,054
Quit joking around.

114
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:41,490
Can we please stop arguing?

115
00:04:41,524 --> 00:04:43,124
Can you stop being droid bait

116
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,159
Out there?

117
00:04:44,193 --> 00:04:45,760
You're getting in my way.

118
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:47,662
Actually, our way.

119
00:04:47,697 --> 00:04:48,363
Well, you want to be the

120
00:04:48,397 --> 00:04:49,631
Best, then you got to think

121
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:50,765
Like it.

122
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,967
And I'm thinking like an arc

123
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:55,504
Trooper.

124
00:04:55,538 --> 00:04:59,674
Care to repeat that, Echo?

125
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:01,076
Come on. Get him, Hevy!

126
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,143
Smack that know-it-all!

127
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:03,478
Cut it out.

128
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:04,546
If you two would focus on

129
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,248
Fighting droids as much as you

130
00:05:06,282 --> 00:05:07,649
Do fighting each other, you

131
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,051
Might stand a chance out there.

132
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:11,853
Sorry, master chief.

133
00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:15,357
Well, master chief,

134
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,491
Our training.

135
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:17,959
I'd rather be taught by a jedi

136
00:05:17,994 --> 00:05:19,461
Than some mercenary bounty

137
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:20,562
Hunter.

138
00:05:20,596 --> 00:05:22,264
Jedi don't have the time to

139
00:05:22,298 --> 00:05:24,299
Train grunts like you.

140
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,368
That's why they hired me.

141
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,607
Listen, boys, when you were

142
00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:34,376
Assigned to me, I had high hopes

143
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,977
For you.

144
00:05:36,012 --> 00:05:37,245
Now we're approaching the end

145
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,413
Of your training, and you

146
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:41,416
Haven't advanced nearly enough.

147
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,952
Even this bad batcher, 99, has

148
00:05:43,986 --> 00:05:46,154
More sense than you guys do, and

149
00:05:46,188 --> 00:05:48,957
He's a maintenance clone.

150
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:50,258
You...you don't give them

151
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:51,426
Enough credit.

152
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,864
You're all a waste of my time.

153
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,641
I understand your concerns,

154
00:06:06,675 --> 00:06:08,743
Master jedi.

155
00:06:08,777 --> 00:06:10,011
Ever since the unfortunate

156
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:12,380
Death of Jango Fett, we have

157
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,082
Had to stretch his DNA to

158
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:16,451
Produce more clones.

159
00:06:16,485 --> 00:06:17,719
A jedi does not feel

160
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:19,821
Concern, Lama Su.

161
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:21,389
However, I have noticed this

162
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,458
Unit of clones have been...

163
00:06:23,492 --> 00:06:25,126
Deficient?

164
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,327
My only thought is for you to

165
00:06:26,362 --> 00:06:29,397
Search the galaxy and find a

166
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,232
Suitable donor for your future

167
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,768
Clones.

168
00:06:36,305 --> 00:06:37,272
And what of the clones

169
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:38,840
Produced so far?

170
00:06:38,874 --> 00:06:40,875
As you know, there is no one

171
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,111
Way to make a clone.

172
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:45,880
Sometimes our efforts are less

173
00:06:45,915 --> 00:06:48,016
Than successful.

174
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,585
Are you suggesting we just

175
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,187
Cast off the domino squad?

176
00:06:53,222 --> 00:06:55,189
They're living beings, not

177
00:06:55,224 --> 00:06:57,191
Objects.

178
00:06:57,226 --> 00:06:58,893
You jedi show too much

179
00:06:58,928 --> 00:07:01,062
Compassion.

180
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:03,331
Nevertheless, as general in

181
00:07:03,365 --> 00:07:05,934
Charge of training, the decision

182
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,502
On what to do with them would

183
00:07:07,536 --> 00:07:10,772
Be yours, master jedi.

184
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:27,288
Gentlemen, who wants to be

185
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:29,190
An arc trooper?

186
00:07:29,224 --> 00:07:30,258
I do, sir!

187
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:31,659
You have to pass your final

188
00:07:31,694 --> 00:07:32,994
Test first.

189
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:34,195
I want you to meet commander

190
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:36,965
Colt of the rancor battalion.

191
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,032
I want you troopers to

192
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:39,567
Remember, we're shoulder to

193
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:42,270
Shoulder on those front lines.

194
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:43,304
Brothers.

195
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:44,906
And sometimes we may quarrel,

196
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,741
But no matter what, we are

197
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:48,843
United.

198
00:07:48,877 --> 00:07:50,478
Rule one:

199
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,447
We fight together.

200
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:55,516
So who's ready to step up first?

201
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:56,718
Let's start with the unit that

202
00:07:56,752 --> 00:07:58,419
Ran the practice test in record

203
00:07:58,454 --> 00:07:59,520
Time...

204
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:01,456
Arc trooper time.

205
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,391
Think he means us, boys?

206
00:08:03,425 --> 00:08:07,161
Bravo unit, step up.

207
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:10,031
Well, bravo for bravo squad.

208
00:08:10,065 --> 00:08:11,132
Show an arc trooper how it's

209
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,134
Done.

210
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,606
Come on, boys.

211
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,041
Maybe we can learn something.

212
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:22,844
Shut up, Echo.

213
00:08:29,818 --> 00:08:31,119
Start the citadel challenge,

214
00:08:31,153 --> 00:08:34,589
Version thx, variable 1138.

215
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:45,900
Go right!

216
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:48,236
Clankers!

217
00:08:55,544 --> 00:08:57,712
We're better than these guys.

218
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:04,118
Okay, this is it.

219
00:09:04,153 --> 00:09:07,121
Go for it.

220
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:20,368
He's going to make it.

221
00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:31,045
I'm impressed.

222
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,980
You trained 'em well.

223
00:09:33,015 --> 00:09:34,215
Who's next?

224
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:36,250
The domino squad.

225
00:09:37,052 --> 00:09:40,488
And how are they?

226
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:43,558
We can do this, guys.

227
00:09:43,592 --> 00:09:44,792
All we have to do is follow

228
00:09:44,827 --> 00:09:47,829
Orders.

229
00:09:53,502 --> 00:09:54,702
Check it out, guys.

230
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:56,137
Time to watch the dominoes

231
00:09:56,171 --> 00:10:00,174
Fall.

232
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:01,742
They are so much better

233
00:10:01,777 --> 00:10:02,577
Than us.

234
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:04,445
Knock it off.

235
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,114
Begin the program.

236
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,416
Let's not take it easy on them.

237
00:10:19,194 --> 00:10:19,994
They're getting farther

238
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:21,028
Than normal.

239
00:10:21,063 --> 00:10:23,664
Maybe so, but they're sloppy.

240
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:25,600
This is nothing.

241
00:10:25,634 --> 00:10:26,400
Give them their next set of

242
00:10:26,435 --> 00:10:27,602
Orders and watch the chaos

243
00:10:27,636 --> 00:10:28,936
Ensue.

244
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:30,371
I'm telling you, these guys

245
00:10:30,405 --> 00:10:32,373
Just aren't ready.

246
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:37,111
I'll flank left.

247
00:10:37,146 --> 00:10:39,280
You flank right.

248
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:40,081
Take it easy.

249
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:41,115
I'm on your side.

250
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:41,883
Get it?

251
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:44,752
Your side, huh?

252
00:10:44,786 --> 00:10:48,856
Pretty unorthodox.

253
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:52,460
Droidbait, behind you!

254
00:10:52,494 --> 00:10:54,428
Man down!

255
00:10:54,463 --> 00:10:55,630
Forget him!

256
00:10:55,664 --> 00:10:59,267
I'm breaking for the citadel.

257
00:11:01,236 --> 00:11:02,103
Hurry!

258
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:04,272
Guys, I think he's injured.

259
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:05,139
Leave him.

260
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:07,341
Come on!

261
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:11,579
We're gonna pass this time.

262
00:11:13,782 --> 00:11:16,584
Okay, I spoke too soon.

263
00:11:19,855 --> 00:11:21,923
That would be putting it

264
00:11:21,957 --> 00:11:23,891
Broke formation, disobeyed

265
00:11:23,926 --> 00:11:25,393
Orders, and you left a man

266
00:11:25,427 --> 00:11:26,594
Behind.

267
00:11:26,628 --> 00:11:28,729
You broke rule number one.

268
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:31,132
I'm sorry, domino squad.

269
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:36,070
This is an automatic failure.

270
00:11:36,104 --> 00:11:36,904
I told you this was going to

271
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:38,339
Happen.

272
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:39,106
We've wasted enough time on

273
00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:40,508
Those losers.

274
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:43,311
Their failure is our failure.

275
00:11:43,345 --> 00:11:44,478
I've made a request to general

276
00:11:44,513 --> 00:11:45,780
Shaak Ti that the domino squad

277
00:11:45,814 --> 00:11:47,281
Be allowed to repeat the final

278
00:11:47,316 --> 00:11:48,583
Test.

279
00:11:48,617 --> 00:11:50,685
Why do you care about them?

280
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:52,386
Why don't you?

281
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,422
I care about getting paid.

282
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:55,356
It's a shame the bounty

283
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,591
Hunter in you sees this only as

284
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,625
A job.

285
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:02,363
More like an impossible task.

286
00:12:02,397 --> 00:12:03,497
These cadets will be the

287
00:12:03,532 --> 00:12:05,132
Finest troopers we've trained.

288
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:06,801
I have faith in them.

289
00:12:06,835 --> 00:12:08,069
Faith?

290
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,804
Oh, you can't be serious,

291
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:10,771
El-Les.

292
00:12:10,806 --> 00:12:11,639
We should treat them as a

293
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:13,241
Special challenge, bric.

294
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,175
We should treat them as

295
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:15,710
Failures.

296
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:17,011
Besides, I've already requested

297
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:18,479
That they be moved to cleanup

298
00:12:18,513 --> 00:12:19,547
And maintenance.

299
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:20,748
That's all they're going to be

300
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,550
Good for.

301
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:23,517
Then I guess the general has

302
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:25,519
A decision to make.

303
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:41,435
General, may we have a word?

304
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,603
You are here to discuss your

305
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,939
Squad, aren't you?

306
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:45,640
How did you...

307
00:12:45,674 --> 00:12:47,808
Ah, jedi, mate.

308
00:12:47,843 --> 00:12:49,644
One doesn't need to be a jedi

309
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:52,346
To feel the stress on your mind.

310
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:53,581
General, we would like to

311
00:12:53,615 --> 00:12:55,349
Request a transfer to another

312
00:12:55,384 --> 00:12:56,284
Squad.

313
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:59,020
Bravo squad, perhaps?

314
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:00,655
I am a jedi, where the

315
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:02,156
Individual and the group are

316
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,959
One in the same, much like you

317
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,260
Clones.

318
00:13:06,295 --> 00:13:08,195
Which is why Fives and I are

319
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,664
Looking out for each other.

320
00:13:09,698 --> 00:13:11,299
As individuals,

321
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,634
But not as a group.

322
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:16,103
You are where you need to be.

323
00:13:16,138 --> 00:13:18,172
Solve your problems as a whole,

324
00:13:18,206 --> 00:13:20,841
Not as individuals.

325
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:22,643
I have decided to allow you and

326
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,345
The rest of your squad to take

327
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:26,347
The test again tomorrow.

328
00:13:45,935 --> 00:13:47,970
You wanted to see me, sir?

329
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:49,638
Near as I can tell, you're

330
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:51,140
The reason your squad's a

331
00:13:51,174 --> 00:13:52,274
Failure.

332
00:13:52,308 --> 00:13:54,476
Ah, well, I'll take that as

333
00:13:54,511 --> 00:13:55,944
A compliment.

334
00:13:55,979 --> 00:13:57,312
It's all a big joke to you,

335
00:13:57,347 --> 00:13:58,647
Right?

336
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:00,015
Like those little nicknames you

337
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,917
And your clone brothers give

338
00:14:01,951 --> 00:14:02,918
Each other.

339
00:14:02,952 --> 00:14:04,653
Oh, I could think

340
00:14:04,687 --> 00:14:06,655
Of one for you right now, sir.

341
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:08,490
Oh, funny.

342
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:09,892
But I think it's all just

343
00:14:09,926 --> 00:14:11,527
A cover.

344
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:14,630
You hate me, don't you?

345
00:14:14,664 --> 00:14:15,497
No, no, no.

346
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:16,832
How could I hate you for doing

347
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:17,933
Your job?

348
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:19,401
You're just pushing me, sir.

349
00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:22,971
No, this is me pushing you.

350
00:14:23,006 --> 00:14:24,440
Come on, clone.

351
00:14:24,474 --> 00:14:25,474
Hit me.

352
00:14:25,508 --> 00:14:27,376
Hit me, you joker.

353
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,577
Can't take anything seriously,

354
00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:29,778
Can you?

355
00:14:29,813 --> 00:14:32,414
You're a real cutup, aren't you?

356
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:35,117
Come on!

357
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:36,418
Thank you, sir.

358
00:14:36,453 --> 00:14:39,755
For what?

359
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:43,392
For my name: Cutup.

360
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:45,127
I like the sound of it.

361
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:47,396
Out of my sight, cadet.

362
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,730
One way or another, you'll be

363
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:50,399
Out of this army.

364
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:55,471
Count on it.

365
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,429
Hevy, you going somewhere?

366
00:15:20,463 --> 00:15:22,264
Get out of here.

367
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:25,134
You're going awol, aren't

368
00:15:25,168 --> 00:15:27,369
Just go back to sleep, 99.

369
00:15:27,403 --> 00:15:28,737
This doesn't concern you.

370
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:30,672
But you can't do this to

371
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:32,074
Your squad.

372
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:33,775
My squad?

373
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,777
We're nothing but a bad batch.

374
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:37,513
Failures.

375
00:15:37,547 --> 00:15:39,581
Like you.

376
00:15:39,616 --> 00:15:41,817
Yeah, but how can I be

377
00:15:41,851 --> 00:15:43,986
A failure when I...I never even

378
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,554
Got my chance?

379
00:15:45,588 --> 00:15:48,390
A chance you're throwing away.

380
00:15:48,424 --> 00:15:49,992
You're always trying to be the

381
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:51,493
Anchor, Hevy.

382
00:15:51,528 --> 00:15:53,629
You know, do it on your own.

383
00:15:53,663 --> 00:15:55,998
Well, maybe you should embrace

384
00:15:56,032 --> 00:15:59,468
The fact that you have a team.

385
00:15:59,502 --> 00:16:01,904
See, I never had that.

386
00:16:01,938 --> 00:16:04,506
But you need them,

387
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,441
And they need you.

388
00:16:06,476 --> 00:16:07,876
Why carry such a heavy burden

389
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:10,078
On your own when you have your

390
00:16:10,113 --> 00:16:13,048
Brothers at your side, Hevy?

391
00:16:13,082 --> 00:16:13,715
Hevy?

392
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,884
Would...stop calling me that!

393
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,586
We're just numbers, 99.

394
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,254
Just numbers.

395
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:21,023
Not to me.

396
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:24,860
To me, you've always had a name.

397
00:16:34,837 --> 00:16:37,806
Hey, where's CT-782?

398
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,809
Yeah, where is CT-782?

399
00:16:40,843 --> 00:16:42,644
If he is not here, we will

400
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,546
Fail.

401
00:16:44,581 --> 00:16:46,949
Not today, brothers.

402
00:16:46,983 --> 00:16:51,086
Today we pass.

403
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,454
And one more thing:

404
00:16:52,488 --> 00:16:54,456
The name's Hevy.

405
00:17:05,134 --> 00:17:07,069
Orders came in clear, mates.

406
00:17:07,103 --> 00:17:08,503
Nothing to repeat, Echo?

407
00:17:08,538 --> 00:17:09,738
Not today.

408
00:17:09,772 --> 00:17:10,872
How's that shoulder treating

409
00:17:10,907 --> 00:17:11,540
You?

410
00:17:11,574 --> 00:17:13,041
I'll live.

411
00:17:13,076 --> 00:17:14,243
We all know what we have

412
00:17:14,277 --> 00:17:16,245
To do.

413
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:38,467
That's it, boys.

414
00:17:38,501 --> 00:17:39,935
Stay together!

415
00:17:39,969 --> 00:17:43,071
Fives, on your left.

416
00:17:43,106 --> 00:17:44,273
Thanks, cutup.

417
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:45,641
No problem, brother.

418
00:17:45,675 --> 00:17:46,608
They seem to be working

419
00:17:46,643 --> 00:17:47,743
Together.

420
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:49,111
Still early.

421
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:52,080
A lot can change.

422
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:04,926
Keep it up.

423
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:06,128
We're doing great.

424
00:18:06,162 --> 00:18:07,763
We might actually pass.

425
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:09,698
Not so fast; still got the

426
00:18:09,732 --> 00:18:12,534
Citadel.

427
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:27,849
All right, prep the

428
00:18:27,884 --> 00:18:28,950
Ascension cables.

429
00:18:28,985 --> 00:18:31,286
Let's scale this thing.

430
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:31,987
Wait a tick.

431
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:33,722
Where are the cables?

432
00:18:33,756 --> 00:18:34,890
They're not in our belts.

433
00:18:34,924 --> 00:18:36,725
Just when things seemed easy.

434
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,427
Well, we can't scale the face

435
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:39,594
Without them.

436
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:40,662
We'll fail the test if we can't

437
00:18:40,697 --> 00:18:41,396
Finish.

438
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:42,831
What's going on?

439
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:43,699
Where are their ascension

440
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:44,666
Cables?

441
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:48,737
Must have gotten lost.

442
00:18:48,771 --> 00:18:50,572
What did you do?

443
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:52,407
I thought you had faith

444
00:18:52,442 --> 00:18:54,443
They'd be the best, right?

445
00:18:54,477 --> 00:18:56,078
Well, the best pass,

446
00:18:56,112 --> 00:18:58,547
No matter what.

447
00:18:58,581 --> 00:18:59,548
General, you have to stop

448
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:00,215
This.

449
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:02,084
This is unfair to the cadets.

450
00:19:02,118 --> 00:19:03,418
Adversity in war is

451
00:19:03,453 --> 00:19:05,420
A constant, el-Les.

452
00:19:05,455 --> 00:19:06,722
But bric has cheated.

453
00:19:06,756 --> 00:19:08,156
The enemy won't play fair

454
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:09,591
Either.

455
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,059
So this is it?

456
00:19:11,094 --> 00:19:12,194
Not exactly.

457
00:19:12,228 --> 00:19:13,428
Those guns up there...

458
00:19:13,463 --> 00:19:14,796
We can use them as a step to

459
00:19:14,831 --> 00:19:17,466
The next level, form a chain,

460
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,700
And use each other

461
00:19:18,735 --> 00:19:19,801
To scale this face.

462
00:19:19,836 --> 00:19:21,103
Use the guns?

463
00:19:21,137 --> 00:19:22,437
Are you crazy?

464
00:19:22,472 --> 00:19:23,238
Trust me.

465
00:19:23,272 --> 00:19:24,906
I know weapons.

466
00:19:24,941 --> 00:19:26,074
I'm gonna draw their fire.

467
00:19:26,109 --> 00:19:28,910
You guys blast 'em.

468
00:19:47,597 --> 00:19:51,066
Well, I'll be...

469
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,300
Creative little clones, aren't

470
00:19:52,335 --> 00:19:53,101
They?

471
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:54,302
No unit has shown such

472
00:19:54,337 --> 00:20:00,675
Ingenuity.

473
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:02,577
We did it!

474
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,380
I knew we could do it, boys!

475
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:06,181
We made it!

476
00:20:06,215 --> 00:20:09,651
Bric, your actions have

477
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:12,154
Brought out the best in these

478
00:20:12,188 --> 00:20:12,888
Looks like they were

479
00:20:12,922 --> 00:20:14,723
Well-Trained, perhaps the

480
00:20:14,757 --> 00:20:16,858
Finest soldiers I've ever seen.

481
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:18,994
Well, maybe you were right,

482
00:20:19,028 --> 00:20:23,465
El-Les.

483
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:24,433
Congratulations.

484
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:26,034
You've graduated.

485
00:20:26,068 --> 00:20:28,203
At ease.

486
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,108
Next stop, arc trooper.

487
00:20:33,142 --> 00:20:34,276
Yeah, how 'bout we face some

488
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,710
Combat first?

489
00:20:35,745 --> 00:20:37,279
You were right, you know,

490
00:20:37,313 --> 00:20:39,047
About everything.

491
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:40,148
I heard you were quite

492
00:20:40,183 --> 00:20:41,850
The leader out there.

493
00:20:41,884 --> 00:20:43,051
No leaders.

494
00:20:43,085 --> 00:20:45,253
We are a team.

495
00:20:45,288 --> 00:20:47,556
All of us, 99.

496
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,490
The army's lucky to have

497
00:20:48,524 --> 00:20:50,559
A clone like you, Hevy.

498
00:20:50,593 --> 00:20:55,831
Not as lucky as I am to have

499
00:20:55,865 --> 00:20:58,300
Well, this is good-Bye,

500
00:20:58,334 --> 00:21:00,202
I guess.

501
00:21:00,236 --> 00:21:02,938
Hevy ships out, and 99 stays

502
00:21:02,972 --> 00:21:04,105
Here.

503
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,373
Eh, we'll see each other

504
00:21:05,408 --> 00:21:06,475
Again.

505
00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:08,210
I mean, how else am I supposed

506
00:21:08,244 --> 00:21:10,278
To get this back from you?

507
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:14,716
You deserve it.

508
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,885
You're one of us.

509
00:21:22,758 --> 00:21:25,026
Today is your graduation.

510
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:26,261
From here, you ship out to

511
00:21:26,295 --> 00:21:28,497
Fight against the separatists

512
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:30,232
And restore peace to the

513
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:31,266
Republic.

514
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,168
Congratulations.

515
00:21:33,202 --> 00:21:35,136
You are no longer cadets.

516
00:21:35,171 --> 00:21:36,972
You are troopers.

517
00:21:37,006 --> 00:21:39,875
May the force be with you.

518
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:41,610
Attention!

519
00:21:41,644 --> 00:21:45,313
Helmets on!

520
00:22:00,164 --> 00:22:01,665
<i>Separatist attack!</i>

521
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:02,499
<i>After the destruction of</i>

<i>Rishi moon, general Grievous</i>

<i>And Asajj Ventress plan</i>

<i>An attack the planet Kamino,</i>

526
00:22:08,973 --> 00:22:11,174
<i>Home of the cloning factories.</i>

527
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,509
<i>Meanwhile, aboard a jedi</i>

528
00:22:12,543 --> 00:22:13,977
<i>Cruiser, jedi knights</i>

529

<i>Message from general Grievous.</i>

532
00:22:20,051 --> 00:22:21,217
We are decrypting the audio,

533
00:22:21,252 --> 00:22:22,252
Sir.

534
00:22:22,286 --> 00:22:23,954
The clone planet of Kamino

535
00:22:23,988 --> 00:22:26,523
Will be a dangerous target.

536
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:28,258
Just make sure you hold up

537
00:22:28,292 --> 00:22:30,260
Your half of the mission.

538
00:22:30,294 --> 00:22:31,795
We must stop the production

539
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:33,096
Of new clones

540
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,332
If we are to win this war.

541
00:22:36,801 --> 00:22:38,201
Kamino.

542
00:22:38,235 --> 00:22:39,035
They're going to attack

543
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,870
Our home planet.

544
00:22:40,905 --> 00:22:42,072
The separatists are taking

545
00:22:42,106 --> 00:22:43,006
Quite the chance

546
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,008
Even considering this.

547
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:45,809
With all due respect,

548
00:22:45,843 --> 00:22:47,510
General, if someone comes

549
00:22:47,545 --> 00:22:49,512
To our home, they better

550
00:22:49,547 --> 00:22:51,281
Be carrying a big blaster.

551
00:22:51,315 --> 00:22:52,449
I concur with captain rex,

552
00:22:52,483 --> 00:22:53,149
Sir.

553
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,418
This is rsonal for us clones.

554
00:22:55,453 --> 00:22:56,252
We'll make sure Kamino

555
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:57,253
Is secure.

556
00:22:57,288 --> 00:22:59,322
Tell your troopers in the 501st

557
00:22:59,357 --> 00:23:00,557
They're going home.

558
00:23:00,591 --> 00:23:02,559
Yes, sir.

559
00:23:10,201 --> 00:23:12,369
All is ready, general.

560
00:23:12,403 --> 00:23:13,570
Good.

561
00:23:13,604 --> 00:23:15,238
We will attack tipoca city

562
00:23:15,272 --> 00:23:16,473
First.

563
00:23:16,507 --> 00:23:18,108
I have the exact locations

564
00:23:18,142 --> 00:23:20,243
Of both the clone dna room

565
00:23:20,277 --> 00:23:22,445
And the clone trooper barracks.

566
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,980
Both shall be annihilated

567
00:23:24,015 --> 00:23:26,016
Under my hand.

568
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,884
Our hands, general.

569
00:23:27,918 --> 00:23:29,452
Count dooku assigned us both

570
00:23:29,487 --> 00:23:30,854
This task.

571
00:23:30,888 --> 00:23:32,989
But of course, assassin.

572
00:23:33,024 --> 00:23:36,426
I look forward to meeting you.

573
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,094
Are the aqua droids prepared

574
00:23:38,129 --> 00:23:40,030
For phase two of the plan?

575
00:23:40,064 --> 00:23:42,265
Yes, mistress.

576
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:13,997
Masters Kenobi and Skywalker,

577
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:15,899
Welcome to Kamino.

578
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:17,901
Greetings, generals.

579
00:24:17,935 --> 00:24:18,735
I wish our arrival

580
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:20,970
Wasn't under such circumstances.

581
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:22,372
We believe Grievous is planning

582
00:24:22,406 --> 00:24:24,841
A separatist attack on Kamino.

583
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,576
But the republic blockade

584
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,812
Is far too strong.

585
00:24:28,846 --> 00:24:31,014
They would not dare.

586
00:24:33,617 --> 00:24:35,385
Ah, look around, Fives.

587
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:36,386
Feels like yesterday

588
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,354
We were here,

589
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:40,356
Heading to target practice.

590
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:42,258
Heh, remember that?

591
00:24:42,293 --> 00:24:43,593
Do I ever.

592
00:24:46,363 --> 00:24:47,831
Hey, 99.

593
00:24:47,865 --> 00:24:49,699
Ha, Echo.

594
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:51,201
Fives.

595
00:24:51,235 --> 00:24:53,203
You actually remember us.

596
00:24:53,237 --> 00:24:54,671
Oh, I remember all my

597
00:24:54,705 --> 00:24:56,272
Brothers.

598
00:24:56,307 --> 00:24:58,007
Is Hevy here?

599
00:24:58,042 --> 00:24:59,642
Where's he?

600
00:24:59,677 --> 00:25:01,478
There was an incident

601
00:25:01,512 --> 00:25:03,713
On the Rishi moon outpost.

602
00:25:03,747 --> 00:25:05,582
He saved our lives,

603
00:25:05,616 --> 00:25:07,784
But he gave up his own.

604
00:25:09,386 --> 00:25:12,989
Uh, let's see!

605
00:25:13,023 --> 00:25:16,326
Hevy gave you his medal?

606
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,161
So why have you returned

607
00:25:18,195 --> 00:25:19,395
To Kamino?

608
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,830
The generals received word

609
00:25:20,865 --> 00:25:22,832
Of an impending attack here.

610
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:25,735
Well, how can I help?

611
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:38,848
Attack formation Echo-3.

612
00:25:38,883 --> 00:25:39,782
Status.

613
00:25:39,817 --> 00:25:41,784
Deflector shields raised.

614
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:43,253
Destroyers in position.

615
00:25:43,287 --> 00:25:45,788
Forward cannons ready.

616
00:25:45,823 --> 00:25:49,058
Landing craft prepared.

617
00:25:49,093 --> 00:25:51,961
All ships are in position.

618
00:25:51,996 --> 00:25:55,598
Commence attack.

619
00:26:03,574 --> 00:26:04,474
The separatist fleet

620
00:26:04,508 --> 00:26:06,142
Is pressing their attack, sir.

621
00:26:06,177 --> 00:26:07,010
Contact command

622
00:26:07,044 --> 00:26:08,344
At tipoca city.

623
00:26:20,224 --> 00:26:23,459
Shore up our defenses.

624
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:24,727
The fleet is not as large

625
00:26:24,762 --> 00:26:26,229
As I expected.

626
00:26:26,263 --> 00:26:28,598
Begin the air strike.

627
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:37,106
Good to see you, general.

628
00:26:37,141 --> 00:26:38,508
Ready to have some fun?

629
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:39,943
You know me, broadside.

630
00:26:39,977 --> 00:26:40,910
I'd rather be up here

631
00:26:40,945 --> 00:26:42,679
Than stuck in a command center.

632
00:27:03,968 --> 00:27:06,169
Warning! Falling debris.

633
00:27:06,203 --> 00:27:07,170
Grievous appears to be

634
00:27:07,204 --> 00:27:08,671
Sacrificing his transports

635
00:27:08,706 --> 00:27:09,806
In favor of protecting

636
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,174
His command ship.

637
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:14,377
Something's not right.

638
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:30,393
Reinforcements have arrived.

639
00:27:30,427 --> 00:27:31,694
Send out the aqua droids

640
00:27:31,729 --> 00:27:34,163
To assemble the assault craft.

641
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:37,000
Focus on the cruisers.

642
00:27:50,147 --> 00:27:51,080
I'm gonna press the attack,

643
00:27:51,115 --> 00:27:52,148
Master.

644
00:27:52,182 --> 00:27:52,949
No, Anakin.

645
00:27:52,983 --> 00:27:53,850
Wait.

646
00:27:53,884 --> 00:27:55,118
It's too easy.

647
00:27:55,152 --> 00:27:56,352
Not even Grievous would attack

648
00:27:56,387 --> 00:27:57,720
So recklessly.

649
00:27:57,755 --> 00:27:59,055
Master, the battle's up here

650
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:01,157
In space, not down there.

651
00:28:01,191 --> 00:28:02,458
The debris from the destroyed

652
00:28:02,493 --> 00:28:04,861
Separatist ships is the key.

653
00:28:04,895 --> 00:28:06,629
What are you thinking?

654
00:28:06,664 --> 00:28:07,630
I think I'd like to go

655
00:28:07,665 --> 00:28:09,632
For a swim.

656
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:24,547
Nothing as of yet.

657
00:28:24,581 --> 00:28:25,548
Only you could be worried

658
00:28:25,582 --> 00:28:26,516
About the ships I already

659
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,650
Shot down.

660
00:28:30,354 --> 00:28:33,323
Wait a minute.

661
00:28:34,992 --> 00:28:36,292
Aqua droids.

662
00:28:36,327 --> 00:28:37,193
Looks as though they're

663
00:28:37,227 --> 00:28:39,195
Assembling assault craft.

664
00:28:46,036 --> 00:28:47,603
Anakin, I was right.

665
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:48,571
Those downed transports

666
00:28:48,605 --> 00:28:49,472
Were hiding ships for

667
00:28:49,506 --> 00:28:51,007
An underwater assault.

668
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:53,609
Anakin, come in!

669
00:28:53,644 --> 00:28:55,111
Hold it right there.

670
00:28:55,145 --> 00:28:57,113
Do not move.

671
00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:39,561
Thanks for the lift, friend.

672
00:29:49,638 --> 00:29:51,306
Anakin, the city is under

673
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,207
Attack.

674
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:54,309
I need you down here now!

675
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:57,178
On my way.

676
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:07,021
Sir, you sent for us?

677
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:08,089
It's a dangerous assignment,

678
00:30:08,123 --> 00:30:09,290
But I want you two up

679
00:30:09,325 --> 00:30:10,291
On the bridge in sniper

680
00:30:10,326 --> 00:30:11,459
Positions.

681
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:12,126
Yes, sir.

682
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:14,829
We're on it.

683
00:30:32,147 --> 00:30:33,147
Watch out!

684
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:40,114
99, get out of here!

685
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:43,117
This is no place for you.

686
00:31:51,393 --> 00:31:52,360
There aren't enough droids

687
00:31:52,394 --> 00:31:53,795
Here to capture the city.

688
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,563
They're trying to distract us.

689
00:31:55,597 --> 00:31:57,398
Go protect the dna chamber.

690
00:31:57,433 --> 00:31:58,900
I'll deal with Grievous.

691
00:31:58,934 --> 00:32:00,902
Got it.

692
00:32:15,117 --> 00:32:16,184
Fives, keep firing.

693
00:32:16,218 --> 00:32:18,519
We can beat these guys.

694
00:32:18,554 --> 00:32:20,521
Zap!

695
00:32:20,556 --> 00:32:21,456
99.

696
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,458
I...I brought you some ammo.

697
00:32:23,492 --> 00:32:24,225
Is there a better spot

698
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:25,460
Than this, a better defensive

699
00:32:25,494 --> 00:32:26,361
Position we can take?

700
00:32:26,395 --> 00:32:27,795
Droids! Behind us!

701
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,833
Look! Grenades!

702
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:35,603
Thanks, 99.

703
00:32:35,637 --> 00:32:36,771
Good job.

704
00:32:36,805 --> 00:32:37,739
Look out.

705
00:32:37,773 --> 00:32:40,475
There's more.

706
00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:41,542
Cadets.

707
00:32:41,577 --> 00:32:42,710
What are you doing here?

708
00:32:42,745 --> 00:32:43,511
We got separated

709
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,479
From our group.

710
00:32:44,513 --> 00:32:45,947
Where were they taking you?

711
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:46,981
The barracks.

712
00:32:47,015 --> 00:32:48,149
Oh, I know the best way

713
00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:48,883
There.

714
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:50,451
Keep firing.

715
00:32:50,486 --> 00:32:51,986
No mercy!

716
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:23,785
Your skills are impressive.

717
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:25,686
Perhaps a match for my own,

718
00:33:25,721 --> 00:33:27,455
Assassin.

719
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:28,589
Count dooku may have taught

720
00:33:28,624 --> 00:33:30,224
You how to swing a lightsaber,

721
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:32,593
General, but that hardly

722
00:33:32,628 --> 00:33:34,695
Makes you my equal.

723
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,230
And yet I am the general

724
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:38,399
In charge of this assault.

725
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:39,967
Remember, assassin,

726
00:33:40,002 --> 00:33:41,068
You are to recover

727
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:42,970
The clone dna.

728
00:33:43,005 --> 00:33:45,139
Why not just destroy it?

729
00:33:45,174 --> 00:33:46,874
Because the dna could unlock

730
00:33:46,909 --> 00:33:49,343
New possibilities for us.

731
00:33:49,378 --> 00:33:50,445
Keep playing with your

732
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:51,579
Droids.

733
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:52,880
I'll handle breaking into

734
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:55,616
The dna room.

735
00:33:55,651 --> 00:33:56,884
Shall I provide you

736
00:33:56,919 --> 00:33:59,454
With a droid escort?

737
00:33:59,488 --> 00:34:01,522
My dear general,

738
00:34:01,557 --> 00:34:02,957
There's nothing you have

739
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:05,793
That I could want.

740
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,942
What are we gonna do?

741
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,310
A separatist victory

742
00:34:22,344 --> 00:34:25,379
Means death for all of us.

743
00:34:25,414 --> 00:34:26,848
The cadet is right.

744
00:34:26,882 --> 00:34:28,382
What are we gonna do?

745
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:32,620
We fight.

746
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:33,521
But our training's not

747
00:34:33,555 --> 00:34:34,555
Finished.

748
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,690
Look around.

749
00:34:35,724 --> 00:34:37,158
We're one in the same,

750
00:34:37,192 --> 00:34:39,393
Same heart, same blood.

751
00:34:39,428 --> 00:34:41,896
Your training is in your blood.

752
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,297
And my blood's boiling

753
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:44,699
For a fight.

754
00:34:44,733 --> 00:34:45,933
This is our home.

755
00:34:45,968 --> 00:34:48,102
This is our war.

756
00:34:48,136 --> 00:34:49,871
What about weapons?

757
00:34:49,905 --> 00:34:53,074
The armory.

758
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:54,709
It's just a few corridors away

759
00:34:54,743 --> 00:34:55,977
Here in the barracks.

760
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,912
I can retrieve all the firepower

761
00:34:57,946 --> 00:34:59,080
That we need.

762
00:34:59,114 --> 00:35:01,182
Hah, so who wants to blast

763
00:35:01,216 --> 00:35:04,519
Some droids?

764
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:19,767
The droids are spread thin.

765
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:22,103
We must press our offensive now.

766
00:35:46,128 --> 00:35:47,395
I was beginning to think

767
00:35:47,429 --> 00:35:49,964
My presence went unnoticed.

768
00:35:49,998 --> 00:35:50,665
You weren't planning

769
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:51,832
On leaving without saying hello,

770
00:35:51,867 --> 00:35:54,435
Were you?

771
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,741
Ha, here it is.

772
00:36:00,776 --> 00:36:02,577
Everything we need is here.

773
00:36:02,611 --> 00:36:04,178
Excellent work, 99.

774
00:36:04,212 --> 00:36:04,879
Hurry up.

775
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:05,746
The droids have almost reached

776
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:06,581
The barracks.

777
00:36:06,615 --> 00:36:09,350
Let's get into position.

778
00:36:12,621 --> 00:36:13,821
Open up.

779
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:15,289
Get those doors open

780
00:36:15,324 --> 00:36:16,991
And scare the remaining clones

781
00:36:17,025 --> 00:36:18,292
Out of hiding.

782
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:19,961
Roger, roger.

783
00:36:23,865 --> 00:36:26,534
Blast them.

784
00:36:27,836 --> 00:36:31,405
All too easy.

785
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,443
Define "easy," general.

786
00:36:35,477 --> 00:36:37,845
Kenobi.

787
00:37:21,463 --> 00:37:24,465
Kenobi, Kamino has fallen.

788
00:37:24,499 --> 00:37:28,202
Your clone army is doomed.

789
00:37:28,236 --> 00:37:31,138
I beg to differ, Grievous.

790
00:37:59,467 --> 00:38:01,268
Cadets, now!

791
00:38:48,449 --> 00:38:49,750
Last one, commander.

792
00:38:49,784 --> 00:38:50,784
Make it count.

793
00:38:50,818 --> 00:38:53,220
I'll get more.

794
00:38:53,254 --> 00:38:54,454
99, you can't.

795
00:38:54,489 --> 00:38:56,490
I'm a soldier like you.

796
00:38:56,524 --> 00:38:57,324
This is what

797
00:38:57,358 --> 00:38:58,492
I was bred for.

798
00:39:01,729 --> 00:39:03,330
99, no!

799
00:39:18,846 --> 00:39:19,813
Commander Cody.

800
00:39:19,847 --> 00:39:22,215
Yes, sir.

801
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,150
The droids have been pushed

802
00:39:23,184 --> 00:39:24,551
Back to the main hangar.

803
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:05,158
We've got to stop meeting

804
00:40:05,193 --> 00:40:06,727
Like this, my friend.

805
00:40:22,643 --> 00:40:23,577
Move it, troopers!

806
00:40:23,611 --> 00:40:26,346
On the double!

807
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,714
Fire!

808
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:43,196
Look! It's the general!

809
00:41:07,455 --> 00:41:10,457
To surrender.

810
00:41:13,195 --> 00:41:15,562
Actually I plan to let
the clones execute you

811
00:41:15,596 --> 00:41:16,830
Right now.

812
00:41:16,864 --> 00:41:18,865
Not this time.

813
00:41:30,211 --> 00:41:31,344
We did it.

814
00:41:31,379 --> 00:41:34,481
We held them back.

815
00:41:34,515 --> 00:41:38,685
We lost a true soldier.

816
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:42,823
He really was one of us.

817
00:41:42,857 --> 00:41:47,060
Echo, Fives.

818
00:41:47,094 --> 00:41:48,728
You both really stepped up

819
00:41:48,763 --> 00:41:50,430
In the heat of battle.

820
00:41:50,464 --> 00:41:52,299
We did what we had to do,

821
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:53,266
Sir,

822
00:41:53,301 --> 00:41:56,636
What any clone would have done.

823
00:41:56,671 --> 00:41:57,771
Both of you showed valor

824
00:41:57,805 --> 00:42:00,640
Out there, real courage.

825
00:42:00,675 --> 00:42:02,809
Reminded me of me, actually.

826
00:42:02,844 --> 00:42:05,145
Echo, Fives,

827
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:06,346
You're both officially

828
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,348
Being made arc troopers.

829
00:42:11,619 --> 00:42:12,519
I don't think the separatists

830
00:42:12,553 --> 00:42:13,253
Will be coming back here

831
00:42:13,287 --> 00:42:14,554
Any time soon.

832
00:42:14,589 --> 00:42:16,356
But if they do,

833
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,924
Kamino will be lucky

834
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:21,226
To have clones like
you defending it.

835
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,796
Good job, men!
