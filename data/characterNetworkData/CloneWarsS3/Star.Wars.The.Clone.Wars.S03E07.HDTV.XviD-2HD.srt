choose wisely.

<i>Criminals Captured!</i>

00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:21,372
<i>Jedi master Plo Koon and
padawan Ahsoka tano</i>

00:00:21,497 --> 00:00:24,355
<i>Successfully thwarted an attempt
on mace windu's life,</i>

<i>Killing bounty hunter
aurra sing In the process.</i>

00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,982
<i>Since that time, young ahsoka has grown
strong in the ways of the force.</i>

10
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:36,049
<i>Now, after several harrowing
adventures alongside her master,</i>

11
00:00:36,174 --> 00:00:39,102
<i>The two jedi have returned to
the temple on coruscant</i>

12
00:00:39,227 --> 00:00:41,165
<i>to receive their next mission.</i>

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,879
Welcome, padawan.

14
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:47,099
In order congratulations are.

15
00:00:47,224 --> 00:00:50,049
Shown your courage and
strength yet again you have.

16
00:00:50,507 --> 00:00:52,471
Job well done, Ahsoka.

17
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,098
And now onto more pressing matters.

18
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,412
To balith you must go, Skywalker.

19
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:02,460
There's a large-scale
civil war on balith.

20
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:04,480
They have requested our assistance.

21
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:07,540
Anakin, you will leave immediately
to command The third legion.

22
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:09,026
I've never been to balith.

23
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:13,186
You will stay here, padawan.
We need your full report.

24
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:15,449
As you wish.

25
00:01:21,357 --> 00:01:23,676
Ahsoka, I sense you're uneasy.

26
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:24,651
What is it?

27
00:01:25,943 --> 00:01:26,665
I...

28
00:01:27,704 --> 00:01:28,578
Nothing.

29
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,100
Master, let me come with you.

30
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:33,926
If I'm not with you,
who else will have your back?

31
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:37,827
Stay here, finish your studies,
get some rest.

32
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,360
You've said it yourself.

33
00:01:39,485 --> 00:01:42,008
I learn more in the field
than I ever do here.

34
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,896
Think of this as a
chance to prove me wrong.

35
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:54,321
And stay out of trouble.

36
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:15,176
She will die, and there's
nothing that you can do.

37
00:02:23,604 --> 00:02:24,390
Enter.

38
00:02:25,656 --> 00:02:27,569
Have a seat, young padawan.

39
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,949
Troubled you are, padawan?

40
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,828
Yes, master yoda.
I've been having dreams.

41
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:45,967
Dreams, you say?

42
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,159
Yes, dreams.
Or visions.

43
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,524
I don't know.
But they're so real.

44
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:56,322
Premonitions. Telling you
something they are.

45
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:59,008
I know I reported otherwise,

46
00:02:59,477 --> 00:03:02,188
but I believe that
aurra sing Isn't dead.

47
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:03,873
She's still alive,

48
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:06,419
and she's preparing to kill
someone close to me.

49
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:10,169
So you begin to see
the true power of the force.

50
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:14,591
Visions they are. Underestimate
them, You must not.

51
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:19,011
Meditate to see clearly.
More experience you need.

52
00:03:24,991 --> 00:03:27,955
These should help you
with your studies, dear.

53
00:03:28,905 --> 00:03:29,932
Study.

54
00:03:30,213 --> 00:03:33,170
I should be out there fighting,
not in here studying.

55
00:03:41,344 --> 00:03:44,663
- Kill her.
- With pleasure.

56
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,064
Senator amidala is in danger.

57
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,159
Senator.

58
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,106
Padawan ahsoka tano
is here to see you.

59
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:08,622
Senator amidala.

60
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:12,554
Ahsoka, It's so good to see you.
How have you been?

61
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:15,645
Honestly, I've been better.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,621
I'm worried for you, senator.

63
00:04:17,746 --> 00:04:19,675
I sense you are in grave danger.

64
00:04:21,223 --> 00:04:23,095
What makes you believe that?

65
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:25,873
I've been having dreams...

66
00:04:26,151 --> 00:04:27,279
Bad dreams.

67
00:04:27,545 --> 00:04:31,145
Padme, I know you're in danger.
I just know it.

68
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,771
what kind of danger?

69
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:36,775
I believe that a very dangerous bounty
hunter is out to assassinate you.

70
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:39,872
This is troubling.

71
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:43,407
Captain, please take
all necessary precautions.

72
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:44,601
You're leaving?

73
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:47,252
Yes, Bail Organa and I
are leading a conference,

74
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:49,289
concerning the refugees from the war.

75
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:51,373
I leave for alderaan In the morning.

76
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:53,417
But the threat to your life...

77
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:57,018
Ahsoka, the refugee situation
is much to crucial to ignore.

78
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:59,185
I called this conference.

79
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,718
It could make an enormous
difference in policy.

80
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,302
It's vital that I go.

81
00:05:04,734 --> 00:05:06,051
Yes, senator.

82
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,901
I'm sure now that it is senator
amidala who is in danger.

83
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,796
Senator amidala, you say?

84
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,924
Yes, master.
I've seen it in my visions.

85
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:45,262
Choose, you must,
how to respond to your visions.

86
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,278
But remember, always in
motion is the future,

87
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:52,407
and many possible futures there are.

88
00:05:53,345 --> 00:05:54,599
Yes, master.

89
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:02,775
Senator!

90
00:06:03,408 --> 00:06:05,017
Ahsoka, what is it?

91
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:08,919
I can't just stay behind
knowing about the threat to your life.

92
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:12,175
Allow me to come with you, please.

93
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:15,380
Well, I suppose it couldn't hurt.

94
00:06:15,963 --> 00:06:18,457
Besides, I enjoy your company.

95
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:22,511
Of course you can join me
as extra security.

96
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,464
Thank you, padme.

97
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:56,847
{PUB}You'll learn to play in time, Ahsoka.

98
00:06:56,972 --> 00:06:58,917
Someday you'll even beat me.

99
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:01,420
It's not that.

100
00:07:01,907 --> 00:07:03,172
what's on your mind?

101
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:06,746
I've been mostly unsure
about my abilities on my own.

102
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:09,428
Usually master skywalker is
there to guide me.

103
00:07:09,964 --> 00:07:11,221
When I was queen,

104
00:07:12,123 --> 00:07:14,759
I felt the same insecurities
as you do now.

105
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,963
I had my advisors but,

106
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:21,131
it was ultimately up to me to
run the entire naboo system.

107
00:07:21,486 --> 00:07:23,650
And I was very afraid at times.

108
00:07:23,932 --> 00:07:26,487
Really? You felt unsure?

109
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:27,821
Oh, yes.

110
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:34,092
I've learned to trust In myself,
 and you will too.

111
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:35,891
Thank you.

112
00:07:36,765 --> 00:07:38,963
- One more game?
- Absolutely.

113
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,471
it's begun.

114
00:08:04,002 --> 00:08:04,876
Padme!

115
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,945
The assassin's inside!

116
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,174
- Ahsoka.
- Stay down.

117
00:08:17,656 --> 00:08:18,956
What's going on?

118
00:08:20,684 --> 00:08:21,558
Nothing.

119
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:25,751
False alarm.
Forgive me, senator.

120
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:34,046
- Are you all right, my lady?
- Yes, captain. I'm fine.

121
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:58,872
- Padme!
- Bail,

122
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:02,622
It's so good to see you. Thank you so
much for hosting this conference.

123
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,524
Dealing with the refugees of this war
needs to be Our number one priority.

124
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:07,780
Absolutely.

125
00:09:08,155 --> 00:09:10,294
Your presence here
is greatly appreciated.

126
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,429
Come.

127
00:09:11,713 --> 00:09:14,098
Senator mothma and I will take
you to your quarters.

128
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,774
Senator, might I have a word
with you in private?

129
00:09:56,655 --> 00:10:00,111
Of course, padawan tano.
If you'll excuse me.

130
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:07,797
I know I made a mistake last night.

131
00:10:07,922 --> 00:10:10,692
But that doesn't mean the
threat to you is any less.

132
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,778
I haven't lost faith in you, Ahsoka.

133
00:10:13,338 --> 00:10:15,659
I know.
And I appreciate that.

134
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,470
I don't mean to interject,
but now is not the time for this.

135
00:10:19,595 --> 00:10:21,872
Senator amidala must prepare
for her summit.

136
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:25,249
But I believe the attempt on
your life is going to happen tonight.

137
00:10:25,534 --> 00:10:26,500
Why tonight?

138
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,203
I had another vision,
and it was much clearer.

139
00:10:29,526 --> 00:10:32,567
I could see more than usual,
even a location.

140
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:35,133
It was large room,
you were giving a speech.

141
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,956
This room, could you
recognize it if you saw it?

142
00:10:38,392 --> 00:10:39,618
Yes, I think I could.

143
00:10:50,986 --> 00:10:53,193
So es anything look familiar?

144
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,320
Yes.

145
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,531
This is it. This is the place
I saw In my vision.

146
00:10:57,929 --> 00:10:59,366
Where would the assassin be?

147
00:10:59,854 --> 00:11:01,959
That's the part I'm not sure of.

148
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:05,803
We are taking all the necessary
precautions, correct, captain?

149
00:11:05,928 --> 00:11:06,957
Yes, milady.

150
00:11:07,222 --> 00:11:09,563
But aurra sing will know
what you plan to do.

151
00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:11,003
She'll find a way in.

152
00:11:11,257 --> 00:11:12,129
Ahsoka,

153
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:15,119
in your vision, does aurra succeed?

154
00:11:16,578 --> 00:11:17,511
I can't tell.

155
00:11:18,088 --> 00:11:19,092
Well, then,

156
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:21,471
at least we have a fighting chance.

157
00:11:27,747 --> 00:11:29,217
Isn't it just beautiful?

158
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:33,661
I really must insist you go
back inside.

159
00:11:33,786 --> 00:11:35,637
It's not safe for you out here.

160
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:38,475
Ahsoka, I can't stop living my life.

161
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,781
You forget,

162
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,185
I'm a friend of the jedi.
I'm no stranger to taking risks.

163
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:47,873
What is it?

164
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:49,935
I'm confused.

165
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:52,915
My visions are telling me one thing,

166
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,195
but reality is telling me another.

167
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,384
I don't know which to believe anymore.

168
00:11:58,012 --> 00:12:00,761
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe no one's out to kill you.

169
00:12:07,235 --> 00:12:10,359
As the conflict that divides
our galaxy escalates,

170
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,701
We cannot lose perspective,

171
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,815
on the value of life
and the price of freedom.

172
00:12:17,641 --> 00:12:19,506
<i>No one knows this truth more...</i>

173
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,124
Than the distinguished senator
padme amidala of naboo.

174
00:12:24,753 --> 00:12:26,243
Thank you, senator organa.

175
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:28,934
I wanted to first thank
you all for coming.

176
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:31,625
This is a cause that is very
important to me.

177
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:35,143
I can remember after the illegal
blockade of my home world,

178
00:12:35,268 --> 00:12:39,674
Naboo, by the trade federation,
how many lives were thrown into chaos.

179
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:42,077
True, in the grand scale of things,

180
00:12:42,202 --> 00:12:43,800
it was a small conflict.

181
00:12:44,571 --> 00:12:47,891
And true, there was only one
battle fought during the occupation.

182
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:51,622
But t us examine the cost
of that one conflict:

183
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:55,030
Hundreds of naboo were forced
from their homes,

184
00:12:55,547 --> 00:13:00,594
Naboo secuty forces and the Gungan
army both incurred heavy casualties,

185
00:13:01,273 --> 00:13:05,145
And the life of jedi master
Qui-gon jinn was lost.

186
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:09,246
And yet now I find myself
a party to and witness of a

187
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,951
full-scale war that has divided
our great republic in two.

188
00:13:13,076 --> 00:13:16,154
Already, more than 100 jedi
have given their lives...

189
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:38,608
Get a medical droid.
We need a medic.

190
00:13:49,106 --> 00:13:50,704
{PUB}The senator will be fine.

191
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,423
It was only a flesh wound.

192
00:13:57,227 --> 00:13:59,842
- I'm sorry.
- For what, ahsoka?

193
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,900
You did all you could.

194
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,674
Did you find the assassin?

195
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,751
She ran off before I could get her.

196
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:07,697
- She?
- Yes, she.

197
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:11,345
I am positive now that it is
Aurra Sing who is out to get you.

198
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:14,144
Please return to coruscant
immediately,

199
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,021
for your own safety.

200
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,248
Padme, I agree with the padawan.

201
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,568
It is far too dangerous for you
to give your speech tonight.

202
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,608
If someone wants me dead,

203
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:25,909
They will follow me wherever I go.

204
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,848
But you know my visions
are all mixed up.

205
00:14:29,148 --> 00:14:31,915
What if what I saw was the
attempt that just happened?

206
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,824
Padme, I'm not willing to
gamble with your life.

207
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:36,628
Wait a minute.

208
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,836
I think I have a way we can get
around putting you in jeopardy,

209
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,050
And have you [...]

210
00:15:35,785 --> 00:15:37,021
All clear, sir.

211
00:15:38,045 --> 00:15:39,729
The upper levels are
cleared, captain.

212
00:15:39,984 --> 00:15:41,819
<i>Sweep complete.
The area is secure.</i>

213
00:15:44,464 --> 00:15:46,945
Fear, in these times,

214
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,531
it is the Greatest weapon wielded
against those who

215
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,640
would stand up for truth and justice.

216
00:15:52,258 --> 00:15:55,453
<i>We have a responsibility as the
elected representatives of the republic</i>

217
00:15:56,333 --> 00:16:01,376
<i>to face our fears and challenge those
who threaten the safety of its people.</i>

218
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:07,235
<i>I stand before you today
bruised but not beaten.</i>

219
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:11,011
<i>The voices of the people
shall be heard.</i>

220
00:16:11,469 --> 00:16:13,942
And together, we shall represent them.

221
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,982
- The homeless shall no longer...
- Aurra's not here.

222
00:16:17,107 --> 00:16:19,932
- What do you mean, she's not here?
- <i>The soldiers who so valiantly,</i>

223
00:16:20,057 --> 00:16:23,356
<i>Fight to protect us must also
be protected once their job is done.</i>

224
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,816
She's not in this room.

225
00:16:25,092 --> 00:16:28,028
<i>We need legislation to defend
the displaced from slavery,</i>

226
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,323
<i>to protect our soldiers from feeling
as if there is no future,</i>

227
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:35,368
<i>beyond their warfare, and we must
open channels through diplomacy,</i>

228
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:37,805
<i>So that we can end this war.</i>

229
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:42,026
I know there are those among the
separatists who would end this conflict.

230
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,178
And I know there are those individuals
in the galaxy who would seek

231
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:47,380
to promote fe and spread chaos.

232
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,891
<i>To those that act as agents
of chaos, I say this.</i>

233
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:55,013
<i>I stand resolute and unyielding.</i>

234
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,884
And if you strike my voice down,

235
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:03,436
Know that a chorus of thousands
shall rise up in its place,

236
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:07,025
For you have no dominion
over the righteous.

237
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:10,288
We are the defenders of truth.

238
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:23,118
You!

239
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,794
I remember you, jedi brat.

240
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,749
Stand down, assassin.

241
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,685
You left me for dead.

242
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,053
Luckily, Hondo pulled me
out of the wreckage.

243
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,097
Surprised you're back to work so soon.

244
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:39,708
Well, a girl's got to make a Living.

245
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,992
Get this door open, now.

246
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,246
Why are you doing this?

247
00:17:49,371 --> 00:17:51,736
Killing me will not stop
the relief effort.

248
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:57,492
Honey, this isn't about your cause.
This is about revenge.

249
00:17:58,011 --> 00:18:02,080
My employer wants to get
even with you, simple as that.

250
00:18:02,338 --> 00:18:03,727
Who hired you?

251
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,356
Enough talk.

252
00:18:05,964 --> 00:18:08,253
Time to see what you're made of, kid.

253
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:22,814
Nice shot.

254
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:26,573
I told you, I'm no
stranger to taking risks.

255
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:31,801
- Senator.
- Captain, She's stunned.

256
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:09,689
Are you all right?

257
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,735
Without ahsoka's foresight,

258
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:14,442
I fear things would have
gone quite differently.

259
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:18,696
Serve you well, your visions
have, young padawan.

260
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,875
Thank you, master yoda.

261
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,280
But we still don't know who's
really behind this.

262
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,845
Concentrate.

263
00:19:27,453 --> 00:19:29,592
Remember.
What do you see?

264
00:19:32,014 --> 00:19:33,027
I see...

265
00:19:34,588 --> 00:19:35,536
Shapes.

266
00:19:37,522 --> 00:19:38,526
Large...

267
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:41,384
Devouring.

268
00:19:42,793 --> 00:19:43,867
I hear...

269
00:19:44,885 --> 00:19:46,111
Laughter...

270
00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:47,996
Bizarre laughter.

271
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:51,047
And... Purple?

272
00:19:52,188 --> 00:19:53,333
I see a color.

273
00:19:54,478 --> 00:19:55,299
Purple.

274
00:19:57,347 --> 00:19:59,779
I don't know what it means.

275
00:20:00,124 --> 00:20:01,825
None of it is familiar to me.

276
00:20:02,414 --> 00:20:04,984
It is to me.
I've been thinking.

277
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:08,339
Aua sing said the person who
hired her simply wanted

278
00:20:08,464 --> 00:20:10,458
for something I did to them.

279
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:12,335
Well, that could be a lot of people.

280
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,237
Yes.

281
00:20:13,724 --> 00:20:16,176
But with ahsoka's added details,

282
00:20:16,663 --> 00:20:19,050
I know someone who
fits the description.

283
00:20:34,918 --> 00:20:35,668
Ziro.

284
00:20:37,431 --> 00:20:40,604
You must be anakin skywalker.

285
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,958
Have you met my padawan, Ahsoka tano?

286
00:20:44,797 --> 00:20:45,801
Padawan.

287
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:51,000
I believe you have a grudge
against senator amidala.

288
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:56,979
and what makes you say something so
utterly ridiculous, youngling?

289
00:20:57,351 --> 00:21:00,726
it's because of senator amidala you're
locked up in this place.

290
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:04,215
The bounty hunter aurra sing
attempted to kill the senator.

291
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,598
I believe you hired her for the job.

292
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,766
I did no such thing.

293
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,520
We have aurra sing in custody.

294
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,540
She told us everything.

295
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:16,858
Wait...she told..
She told you what?

296
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,713
Impossible.

297
00:21:19,037 --> 00:21:21,814
I should've hired someone Better.

298
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:28,402
you just aranteed yourself an extra-long
vacation in this lovely establishment.

299
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:33,275
Do you see the
conditions I'm living in?

300
00:21:34,532 --> 00:21:38,150
That insipid senator put me in here.

301
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,873
She deserves to die for leaving
me to rot in this squalor!

302
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,154
Well, thanks to you, ziro,

303
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:48,863
and that little confession,
you've just officially failed.

304
00:21:49,444 --> 00:21:51,648
You'll never get away with this.

305
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:56,481
You have no idea what I'm capable of!

306
00:21:57,231 --> 00:22:00,759
