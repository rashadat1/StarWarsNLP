1
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:18,644
<i>Separatist attack!</i>

2
00:00:19,131 --> 00:00:22,113
<i>After the destruction of the Republic
outpost on the Rishi moon,</i>

3
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:26,501
<i>General Grievous and Asajj Ventress
plan an attack on the planet Kamino,</i>

4
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,737
<i>home of the cloning factories.</i>

5
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,864
<i>Meanwhile, aboard a Jedi cruiser,</i>

6
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,951
<i>Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker
and Obi-Wan Kenobi</i>

7
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,329
<i>examine an intercepted message
from General Grievous.</i>

8
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:39,581
We are decrypting the audio, sir.

9
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,874
<i>The clone planet of Kamino
will be a dangerous target.</i>

10
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:47,441
<i>Just make sure you hold up
your half of the mission.</i>

11
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:50,494
<i>We must stop
the production of new clones</i>

12
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:52,678
<i>if we are to win this war.</i>

13
00:00:54,411 --> 00:00:55,411
Kamino...

14
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:58,225
They're going to attack
our home planet.

15
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:02,031
The Separatists are taking
quite the chance even considering this.

16
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,224
With all due respect, General,

17
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:06,341
if someone comes to our home,

18
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:08,734
they better be carrying
a big blaster.

19
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:10,604
I concur with Captain Rex, sir.

20
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,823
This is personal for us clones.

21
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,798
We'll make sure Kamino is secure.

22
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:18,065
Tell your troopers in the 501st
they're going home.

23
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:29,798
<i>All is ready, General.</i>

24
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:31,134
Good.

25
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:33,671
We will attack Tipoca City first.

26
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:37,521
<i>I have the exact locations of both
the clone DNA room</i>

27
00:01:37,991 --> 00:01:39,892
<i>and the clone trooper barracks.</i>

28
00:01:40,181 --> 00:01:43,171
Both shall be annihilated
under my hand.

29
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,179
<i>Our hands, General.</i>

30
00:01:45,591 --> 00:01:48,317
<i>Count Dooku assigned us both
this task.</i>

31
00:01:48,671 --> 00:01:50,371
But of course, assassin.

32
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:52,701
I look forward to meeting you.

33
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:57,492
Are the aqua droids prepared
for phase two of the plan?

34
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:58,785
Yes, mistress.

35
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:31,217
Masters Kenobi and Skywalker.

36
00:02:31,941 --> 00:02:33,341
Welcome to Kamino.

37
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:35,131
Greetings, generals.

38
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:38,634
I wish our arrival wasn't
under such circonstances.

39
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:42,329
We believe Grievous is planning
a Separatist attack on Kamino.

40
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:45,711
But the Republic blockade
is far too strong.

41
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:48,001
They would not dare.

42
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:55,008
Look around, Fives.
Feels like yesterday we were here,

43
00:02:55,991 --> 00:02:57,841
heading to target practice.

44
00:02:58,711 --> 00:02:59,763
Remember that?

45
00:03:00,111 --> 00:03:01,611
Do I ever.

46
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:10,651
You actually remember us.

47
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:13,321
I remember all my brothers.

48
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:15,381
Is Hevy here?

49
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:16,738
Where's he?

50
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:21,121
There was an incident
on the Rishi moon outpost.

51
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,971
He saved our lives,
but he gave up his own.

52
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:28,375
I see...

53
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:32,831
Hevy gave you his medal?

54
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:36,741
So why have you returned to Kamino?

55
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:40,387
The generals received word
of an impending attack here.

56
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:43,307
How can I help?

57
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,291
Attack formation Echo-3.

58
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:59,071
- Status.
- Deflector shields raised.

59
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:00,934
Destroyers in position.

60
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:02,701
Forward cannons ready.

61
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:05,241
Landing craft prepared.

62
00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:09,391
All ships are in position.

63
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:11,451
Commence attack.

64
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,864
The Separatist fleet
is pressing their attack, sir.

65
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,974
Contact command at Tipoca City.

66
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:39,681
Shore up our defenses.

67
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:43,771
The fleet is not as large
as I expected.

68
00:04:44,571 --> 00:04:46,121
Begin the air strike.

69
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,171
Good to see you, General.
Ready to have some fun?

70
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:57,764
You know me, broadside.

71
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,342
I'd rather be up here
than stuck in a command center.

72
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:23,824
<i>Warning! Falling debris.</i>

73
00:05:24,111 --> 00:05:26,664
Grievous appears
to be sacrificing his transports

74
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:28,870
in favor of protecting
his command ship.

75
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:30,951
Something's not right.

76
00:05:46,201 --> 00:05:48,056
Reinforcements have arrived.

77
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,606
Send out the aqua droids
to assemble the assault craft.

78
00:05:53,481 --> 00:05:54,691
Focus on the cruisers.

79
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,870
I'm gonna press the attack, master.

80
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,691
Wait.
It's too easy.

81
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:15,311
Not even Grievous
would attack so recklessly.

82
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,879
Master, the battle's up here in space,
not down there.

83
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:22,591
The debris from the destroyed
Separatist ships is the key.

84
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:24,342
What are you thinking?

85
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,792
I think I'd like to go for a swim.

86
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,191
Nothing as of yet.

87
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,405
Only you could be worried
about the ships I already shot down.

88
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:49,493
Wait a minute.

89
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,054
Aqua droids.

90
00:06:54,271 --> 00:06:56,625
Looks as though
they're assembling assault craft.

91
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:05,484
Anakin, I was right.

92
00:07:05,651 --> 00:07:08,811
Those downed transports were hiding
ships for an underwater assault.

93
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:10,180
Anakin, come in.

94
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:12,974
Hold it right there.

95
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,184
Do not move.

96
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,057
Thanks for the lift, friend.

97
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,440
Anakin, the city is under attack.

98
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,489
I need you down here now.

99
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,407
On my way.

100
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,210
Sir, you sent for us?

101
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,173
It's a dangerous assignment,
but I want you two up on the bridge

102
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,589
in sniper positions.

103
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,520
We're on it.

104
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:48,619
Watch out!

105
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,310
Kill them all.

106
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,770
99, get out of here!

107
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,310
This is no place for you.

108
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,363
There aren't enough droids here
to capture the city.

109
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,863
They're trying to distract us.
Go protect the DNA chamber.

110
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,156
- I'll deal with Grievous.
- Got it.

111
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,341
Fives, keep firing.
We can beat these guys.

112
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,150
99.

113
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,763
Here's some ammo.

114
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,763
Is there a better spot,
a better defensive position we can take?

115
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,100
Droids! Behind us!

116
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,227
Look! Grenades!

117
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,850
Thanks, 99.
Good job.

118
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,903
Look out. There's more.

119
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,032
Cadets. What are you doing here?

120
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,244
- We got separated from our group.
- Where were they taking you?

121
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,350
The barracks.

122
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,205
I know the best way there.

123
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,090
Keep firing.
No mercy!

124
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,810
Your skills are impressive.

125
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,500
Perhaps a match for my own,
assassin.

126
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,977
Count Dooku may have taught you
how to swing a lightsaber, General,

127
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,930
but that hardly makes you my equal.

128
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,590
And yet I am the general
in charge of this assault.

129
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,580
Remember, assassin,

130
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,099
you are to recover the clone DNA.

131
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,553
Why not just destroy it?

132
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,610
Because the DNA could unlock
new possibilities for us.

133
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,060
Keep playing with your droids.

134
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,910
I'll handle breaking
into the DNA room.

135
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,525
Shall I provide you
with a droid escort?

136
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,870
My dear General,

137
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:20,270
there's nothing you have
that I could want.

138
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,629
What are we gonna do?

139
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,003
"A Separatist victory

140
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,820
"means death for all of us."

141
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,493
The cadet is right.

142
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,943
What are we gonna do?

143
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,110
We fight.

144
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,019
But our training's not finished.

145
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,450
Look around.

146
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,510
We're one in the same,
same heart, same blood.

147
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,360
Your training is in your blood.

148
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,213
And my blood's boiling for a fight.

149
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,723
This is our home.

150
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,450
This is our war.

151
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,367
What about weapons?

152
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,270
The armory.

153
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,693
It's just a few corridors away
here in the barracks.

154
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,543
I can retrieve all the firepower
that we need.

155
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,963
So who wants to blast some droids?

156
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,640
The droids are spread thin.
We must press our offensive now.

157
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,511
I was beginning to think
my presence went unnoticed.

158
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,139
You were planning of leaving
without saying hello?

159
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,242
Here it is.
Everything we need is here.

160
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,873
Excellent work, 99.

161
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,323
Hurry up. The droids
have almost reached the barracks.

162
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,900
Let's get into position.

163
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,368
Open up.

164
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,770
Get those doors open and scare
the remaining clones out of hiding.

165
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,530
Roger, roger.

166
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,750
Blast them.

167
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,240
All too easy.

168
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,670
Define "easy", General.

169
00:15:36,443 --> 00:15:39,213
Kenobi, Kamino has fallen.

170
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:42,493
Your clone army is doomed.

171
00:15:43,303 --> 00:15:45,483
I beg to differ, Grievous.

172
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,558
Cadets, now!

173
00:17:03,573 --> 00:17:05,525
Last one, Commander.
Make it count.

174
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:07,133
I'll get more.

175
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,195
99, you can't.

176
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:11,151
I'm a soldier like you.

177
00:17:11,837 --> 00:17:13,241
This is what I was bred for.

178
00:17:16,777 --> 00:17:17,577
99!

179
00:17:33,863 --> 00:17:35,012
<i>Commander Cody.</i>

180
00:17:37,205 --> 00:17:39,415
The droids have been pushed back
to the main hangar.

181
00:18:19,123 --> 00:18:21,517
We've got to stop meeting like this,
my friend.

182
00:18:37,756 --> 00:18:39,623
Move it, troopers!
On the double!

183
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,580
Fire!

184
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,719
Look! It's the general!

185
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:23,553
I suppose
you expect me to surrender.

186
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:31,683
Actually, I plan to let the clones
execute you right now.

187
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:33,563
Not this time.

188
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:46,583
We did it.

189
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,020
We held them back.

190
00:19:50,103 --> 00:19:52,133
We lost a true soldier.

191
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,783
<i>He really was one of us.</i>

192
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,413
You both really stepped up
in the heat of battle.

193
00:20:06,013 --> 00:20:08,013
We did what we had to do, sir,

194
00:20:08,703 --> 00:20:10,710
what any clone would have done.

195
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,313
Both of you showed valor out there,
real courage.

196
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,800
Reminded me of me, actually.

197
00:20:20,713 --> 00:20:23,389
You're both officially being made
ARC troopers.

198
00:20:26,907 --> 00:20:29,876
I don't think the Separatists
will be coming back here any time soon.

199
00:20:30,043 --> 00:20:31,293
But if they do,

200
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:35,401
Kamino will be lucky
to have clones like you defending it.

201
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:37,353
Good job, men.
