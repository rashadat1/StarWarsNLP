1
00:00:09,397 --> 00:00:14,066
The challenge of hope is
to overcome corruption.

2
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:18,158
<i>Desperate times on Mandalore!</i>

3
00:00:18,283 --> 00:00:20,946
<i>Having won neutrality for
the Mandalorian system,</i>

4
00:00:21,249 --> 00:00:23,783
<i>Duchess Satine now
finds herself an outsider</i>

5
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:25,899
<i>with little aid to her people.</i>

6
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,197
<i>Supplies are impossible to come by,</i>

7
00:00:28,322 --> 00:00:30,102
<i>except on the black market.</i>

8
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:34,097
<i>As a result, the Duchess faces
a world consumed by greed.</i>

9
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:37,232
<i>Hoping to alleviate some of
the tensions rising on the</i>

10
00:00:37,357 --> 00:00:38,874
<i>capital city of Sundari,</i>

11
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:41,800
<i>Satine has called upon her
friend Padm√© Amidala</i>

12
00:00:41,968 --> 00:00:44,511
<i>to make a
diplomatic visit....</i>

13
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:05,323
Senator.

14
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:07,826
Duchess, it's good to see you.

15
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,370
Thank you for coming, padme.

16
00:01:10,823 --> 00:01:15,333
I know our decision to stay neutral
has caused distress in the senate.

17
00:01:15,657 --> 00:01:19,546
But for many here, the fallout
from your war has been too much.

18
00:01:19,714 --> 00:01:22,285
If your government has trade
concerns, we can talk.

19
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:24,485
Many systems have been affected.

20
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:29,588
I assure you not everyone in the
Republic has neglected Mandalore,

21
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:32,040
and there are those of
us who would still vote,

22
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:33,808
to give you any help you require.

23
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:36,376
The help we need now is
opening trade routes

24
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:38,398
so we may get
supplies more freely.

25
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,276
We are making progress
in the senate.

26
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:45,383
Forgive me, padme. I did not bring
you here to discuss politics.

27
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:47,841
I had hoped to show you
the new mandalore.

28
00:01:50,203 --> 00:01:52,503
Not the typical mandalorian welcome.

29
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:55,493
Senator organa teased you'd
have a royal court waiting.

30
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:59,692
I just wanted to greet you myself,
before the others.

31
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:17,616
Now, this is a mandalorian Welcome.

32
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:19,998
We are a people of tradition.

33
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,846
Hurry up.
Get that stuff unloaded quickly.

34
00:03:07,356 --> 00:03:09,930
Here comes the customs official.

35
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:16,072
Nice day here on Mandalore.

36
00:03:17,015 --> 00:03:19,944
It is. Let's try not to ruin it.

37
00:03:20,376 --> 00:03:22,599
I don't get your meaning.

38
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,709
I think you do.

39
00:03:25,357 --> 00:03:28,013
Your arrival isn't listed
here on my schedule.

40
00:03:28,138 --> 00:03:31,286
So what exactly are you
unloading on my dock?

41
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:35,138
Must be a clerical oversight.

42
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:37,884
I'm sure it won't happen again.

43
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:42,506
Normally there would be five times
as many officers out here.

44
00:03:42,631 --> 00:03:44,089
They're off at the parade.

45
00:03:44,214 --> 00:03:47,019
Some big shot just arrived On mandalore.

46
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:48,111
You're lucky.

47
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:52,573
Oh, luck has nothing
to do with it.

48
00:03:52,948 --> 00:03:54,883
Well, just in case,

49
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,844
deal with me directly
in the future. Got it?

50
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,275
as you wish.

51
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:11,051
Esteemed colleagues,

52
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:13,468
leaders of mandalore, friends,

53
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:17,086
I'm afraid our neutrality has
caused our people to suffer.

54
00:04:17,211 --> 00:04:19,590
The war between the
separatists and the republic

55
00:04:19,715 --> 00:04:21,738
rages across Our galaxy.

56
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:24,931
It has caused trade routes
to be closed to mandalore

57
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:28,752
And has forced us to turn to a
black market filled with corruption.

58
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:30,799
We know what is happening, Almec.

59
00:04:30,924 --> 00:04:33,708
- What will be done about it?
- Mandalore should not need,

60
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,201
to pay smugglers to feed its people.

61
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:38,272
It's not that we want
to deal with smugglers.

62
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:39,569
We have no alternative.

63
00:04:39,694 --> 00:04:41,414
I'm sure you and the trade Federation

64
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:44,207
make a profit whether our
business is legitimate or not.

65
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,802
- I resent that!
- ladies and gentlemen,

66
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:48,869
please, order.
Please.

67
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:52,372
prime minister almec seems
a bit overwhelmed.

68
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:56,771
Your services as a negotiator,
please, be my guest.

69
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:59,720
Perhaps they will listen
to a new voice.

70
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:01,757
Ruling council,

71
00:05:01,882 --> 00:05:03,085
may I speak?

72
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:05,230
Senator amidala.

73
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:09,687
The floor is yours.

74
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:11,528
I hear your worries,

75
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:12,991
your frustration,

76
00:05:13,116 --> 00:05:15,930
But the longer you argue,
the more your people suffer.

77
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:19,369
You are right. New trade routes
are essential to survival,

78
00:05:19,537 --> 00:05:23,298
but the black market is no substitute
for legitimate and legal trade.

79
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,899
- What would you propose, Senator?
-  The republic can provide Security.

80
00:05:27,024 --> 00:05:29,281
The republic's own dealings
with the black market

81
00:05:29,406 --> 00:05:31,906
- far surpass mandalore's.
- I agree.

82
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,403
To come here,

83
00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:38,097
a member of the Republic senate,
and lecture to us about corruption.

84
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:44,811
The corporate alliance
controls everything.

85
00:05:45,085 --> 00:05:46,027
Silence!

86
00:05:50,193 --> 00:05:53,872
I told senator amidala that
Mandalore was not part of the War,

87
00:05:53,997 --> 00:05:56,656
yet here I find a battle
in my own palace.

88
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,352
I call this meeting adjourned.

89
00:05:59,477 --> 00:06:02,636
We will reconvene and allow
cooler heads to prevail.

90
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:14,983
Come on, you worms.

91
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,093
Get those barrels inside.

92
00:06:23,935 --> 00:06:25,699
What is this stuff?

93
00:06:26,062 --> 00:06:28,324
This stuff is slabin,

94
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,260
A diluting agent.

95
00:06:30,385 --> 00:06:34,945
If we add it, we can make twice
as much tea at twice the profit.

96
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:36,848
Isn't it toxic?

97
00:06:38,318 --> 00:06:42,577
Only if the dosage is wrong,
so get your mixture right.

98
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:54,965
Tell me, padme,

99
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:58,635
how do you feel about the republic's
war with the separatists?

100
00:06:58,803 --> 00:07:00,393
It's so complicated.

101
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:04,133
As you know, in the senate,
the chancellor says it's going very well

102
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,147
but my sources say otherwise.

103
00:07:07,687 --> 00:07:09,688
and how does that make you feel?

104
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:13,511
there are times I wish I could
follow mandalore's lead,

105
00:07:14,302 --> 00:07:15,380
neutrality,

106
00:07:15,938 --> 00:07:17,487
and not just in the war.

107
00:07:17,782 --> 00:07:19,566
But the politics as well?

108
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:22,221
The contamination of
greed reaches deep

109
00:07:22,346 --> 00:07:24,228
and far within the republic,

110
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:26,705
corporations, trade guilds,

111
00:07:26,873 --> 00:07:29,500
Too many senators serving
their own interests.

112
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,055
There are still those of us who work
to overcome the corruption and,

113
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,214
believe it to be possible.

114
00:07:36,382 --> 00:07:38,308
Enough of this dreary talk.

115
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:40,031
A new hospital has opened.

116
00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:43,588
Tomorrow you and I shall visit,
see true good at work.

117
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,554
It will do us good.

118
00:08:06,888 --> 00:08:08,583
Orderly, what's going on here?

119
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,289
I have no idea, madam.

120
00:08:10,414 --> 00:08:13,016
Dr. Zaz is handling the Outbreak.
He's inside.

121
00:08:42,782 --> 00:08:44,302
What is happening here?

122
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:47,504
Duchess, I'm sorry no one
has come to speak to you.

123
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:50,488
- These children have been Poisoned.
- How?

124
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:52,840
We don't know.

125
00:08:53,306 --> 00:08:54,968
I'm afraid.

126
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,654
We've gotten reports
from across the planet.

127
00:08:58,874 --> 00:09:00,434
Have you identified a cause?

128
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,556
The children here all
came from the same school.

129
00:09:03,886 --> 00:09:05,441
We're testing their food.

130
00:09:05,674 --> 00:09:08,482
If we find something,
perhaps we can create an antidote.

131
00:09:08,808 --> 00:09:10,705
But it will take some time.

132
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,937
Which they may not have.

133
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:18,397
{PUB}What if it's not a poison?

134
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:21,245
- It must be death watch.
- I'm not so sure.

135
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,951
In the past, the death watch
attacks have only been directed

136
00:09:24,076 --> 00:09:26,616
at myself and the administration,
not the children.

137
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,376
They are terrorists.

138
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,121
Perhaps the senator's visit
has inspired them.

139
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:32,236
Terrorists?

140
00:09:32,361 --> 00:09:35,449
Our minds should be on the sick
children that are dying in the streets.

141
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:37,537
What are you going to do
to save them?

142
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:40,773
I must speak to the ruling
council about this matter.

143
00:09:43,976 --> 00:09:47,178
I refuse to believe that Death Watch
has anything to do with this.

144
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:49,877
I agree. His concern
for the children...

145
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:51,499
was practically none.

146
00:09:51,783 --> 00:09:53,602
All he thinks about is politics.

147
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,021
Well, we can't just sit here
and do nothing.

148
00:09:56,189 --> 00:09:57,803
My thoughts exactly.

149
00:09:59,037 --> 00:10:00,669
Thank you all for coming.

150
00:10:00,794 --> 00:10:03,263
I suppose you're wondering
why I asked you here.

151
00:10:03,388 --> 00:10:05,989
As my personal guards, you are
the only ones I can trust

152
00:10:06,157 --> 00:10:07,739
to investigate this matter.

153
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,594
We have little time.

154
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:12,128
That is why I have asked
for your help.

155
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:13,371
Padme?

156
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,648
Each of you will be getting a
special comlink and datapad,

157
00:10:16,773 --> 00:10:20,252
Means of direct communication,
and location you should investigate.

158
00:10:20,546 --> 00:10:22,898
This must be a closed-loop affair.

159
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,127
Hundreds of children
have been poisoned.

160
00:10:25,252 --> 00:10:28,259
they are our children,
and they need our help.

161
00:10:28,738 --> 00:10:31,536
This is a mandalorian matter,
And we must find out

162
00:10:31,808 --> 00:10:33,502
who dares poison our children.

163
00:10:33,627 --> 00:10:35,662
Thank you.
Thank you all.

164
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,559
- So where do we start?
- The schools.

165
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:52,718
Thank you for allowing us to
inspect the school, superintendent.

166
00:10:52,971 --> 00:10:54,512
My pleasure, duchess.

167
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,083
We've cleared the food here.
None of it is tainted.

168
00:10:58,352 --> 00:11:00,085
What about what they
ate yesterday?

169
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:02,514
the menu of food is pretty
regular here.

170
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,714
We would've caught something
with our tests.

171
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:06,670
What about their drinks, Doctor?

172
00:11:06,795 --> 00:11:08,545
No, they drink fresh water.

173
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,845
It's impossible for it to be tainted.

174
00:11:11,141 --> 00:11:12,222
Not the water.

175
00:11:12,489 --> 00:11:14,099
What about the bottled drinks?

176
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:16,268
Those are not part of
the school's menu.

177
00:11:16,436 --> 00:11:18,631
They are allowed through
an outside vendor.

178
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:21,501
Excuse me, child.
I must borrow your drink.

179
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,656
How could this have happened?

180
00:11:40,781 --> 00:11:42,156
It's not your fault.

181
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,758
I appreciate that.

182
00:11:44,214 --> 00:11:47,416
However, for an outbreak
of this size to occur,

183
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,396
I'm afraid it's a sign of a much,
much deeper seeded

184
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:53,573
- corruption than I had imagined.
- Duchess, we found something.

185
00:11:56,203 --> 00:11:59,436
This tea contains a
high level of slabin.

186
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:01,899
I didn't know slabin was lethal.

187
00:12:02,142 --> 00:12:04,774
it usually isn't,
but mixed with the tea,

188
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:06,290
and at this concentration,

189
00:12:06,415 --> 00:12:08,945
I'm certain it's the cause
of the children's Illness.

190
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,672
The school must have an
import log, correct?

191
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:13,972
Yes.
I believe so.

192
00:12:14,097 --> 00:12:16,787
So we should be able to find
out where the tea came from.

193
00:12:16,912 --> 00:12:19,073
Well, then let's get to the docks.

194
00:12:26,382 --> 00:12:28,048
Everything's here, satine.

195
00:12:28,216 --> 00:12:30,800
Everything except the records
for the tea shipments.

196
00:12:30,968 --> 00:12:33,970
It looks like the school's import
log has been erased.

197
00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:36,306
There's no record of
an outside vendor.

198
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:39,102
superintendent,
hold it right there!

199
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:42,562
I'm actually on my way
to the hospital. I have to go.

200
00:12:43,856 --> 00:12:44,731
Stop him!

201
00:12:52,657 --> 00:12:57,370
Tell me what's going on here,
Or else my guards will not be as

202
00:12:57,495 --> 00:12:59,427
- Satine...
- Padme, please.

203
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,914
Where did you get the tea?

204
00:13:02,162 --> 00:13:05,476
Please, I never meant
to harm anyone. I just--

205
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:08,474
I needed to cut costs.

206
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:10,215
The school's budget was too low.

207
00:13:10,383 --> 00:13:13,176
The school has received
sufficient government funding.

208
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:17,211
Look, they offered me a great deal.

209
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,966
I could keep some
money for myself too,

210
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:22,435
but I didn't know that
the drinks were poison.

211
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:24,646
All this because you were greedy?

212
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:27,334
I am not the only one making
money off this operation.

213
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:29,818
There are others more
guilty than I am.

214
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:31,528
Was death watch involved?

215
00:13:31,696 --> 00:13:33,970
Death Watch?
I don't know.

216
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:36,473
I dealt with a middleman,
an importer.

217
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:37,781
His name's Siddiq.

218
00:13:37,906 --> 00:13:40,537
He works for a shipping
company not too far from here.

219
00:13:40,705 --> 00:13:42,072
Tell us where.

220
00:13:45,465 --> 00:13:48,587
Sure, I bribed the school official.
What's the problem?

221
00:13:48,952 --> 00:13:50,755
What you've done is illegal.

222
00:13:50,923 --> 00:13:53,523
Beyond these stars,
there's a war going on.

223
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,651
As long as my company imports goods,

224
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:58,221
most people turn a blind
eye to anything else.

225
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:01,016
We are not most people, Mr. Siddiq.

226
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:04,449
my corporate contracts
protect me, Duchess,

227
00:14:05,187 --> 00:14:06,900
So I'll play your little game.

228
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:10,386
Look, I'm sorry there
are sick children. I truly am.

229
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:12,110
But I'm just a messenger.

230
00:14:12,407 --> 00:14:14,070
Where do yoget the tea?

231
00:14:14,322 --> 00:14:16,887
From mooga.
The commerce guild controls it.

232
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,015
Here, I have nothing to hide.

233
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:20,535
Here we are.

234
00:14:20,703 --> 00:14:22,639
Shipping schedules from mooga.

235
00:14:22,764 --> 00:14:25,092
Right there, the highlighted ones.

236
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,251
And a customs official reports
these to the government?

237
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:29,541
As far as I know.

238
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,739
Are these all for the ones
bringing in the tea?

239
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:34,758
No, I'd have to narrow that down.

240
00:14:35,968 --> 00:14:37,886
Okay, okay.
No problem.

241
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,994
There you go.

242
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,259
Look, they're actually
bringing in a shipment tonight.

243
00:14:44,475 --> 00:14:46,218
You want to know which dock?

244
00:14:52,473 --> 00:14:54,569
I must say, when I came to visit,

245
00:14:54,737 --> 00:14:57,405
hadn't pictured us in
such an informal setting.

246
00:14:57,573 --> 00:15:00,601
Yes, well, from what
master Kenobi tells me,

247
00:15:00,726 --> 00:15:05,543
During your tenure as queen, you became
quite familiar with such excursions.

248
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:09,918
one can only survive the rigors of
courtly formalities for so long.

249
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:12,610
We are of the same mind.

250
00:15:18,729 --> 00:15:20,929
Duchess, there's a shipment arriving.

251
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,113
The smugglers.

252
00:15:28,238 --> 00:15:30,982
- We'll soon find out.
- Shall I call in more security?

253
00:15:31,316 --> 00:15:34,499
No, let's wait and
see what transpires.

254
00:15:34,624 --> 00:15:36,693
Look, a customs official.

255
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:48,461
Welcome back, gentlemen.

256
00:15:49,535 --> 00:15:51,775
I'm here for my...Inspection.

257
00:15:53,713 --> 00:15:54,785
Certainly.

258
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,695
How can they operate
with such impunity?

259
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:19,529
I need to find out how far up the chain
of command this corruption goes.

260
00:16:24,387 --> 00:16:27,621
{PUB}I'm sorry, duchess, but what
you're saying, It's impossible.

261
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:30,863
impossible? We witnessed it
with our own eyes.

262
00:16:30,988 --> 00:16:33,751
Bribery of a customs official
at the shipping docks?

263
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:35,028
I'm afraid not.

264
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:37,166
The docks are a highly secure area,

265
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,882
free of dangerous criminals.

266
00:16:39,163 --> 00:16:40,977
but not free of corruption.

267
00:16:41,102 --> 00:16:44,262
The most dangerous weapon in
the galaxy is money, captain.

268
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,390
Smuggling does not take
place on my watch.

269
00:16:47,558 --> 00:16:49,537
And what about when
you're not watching?

270
00:16:49,662 --> 00:16:52,486
I'm always watching, senator.

271
00:16:52,855 --> 00:16:55,454
and were you watching as
children were dying?

272
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:56,900
Who was watching then?

273
00:16:57,068 --> 00:16:59,069
- Duchess, with all due respect...
- No, captain.

274
00:16:59,237 --> 00:17:03,114
If you want my respect, you will arrest
these criminals and stop stalling.

275
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,282
Stalling?

276
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,484
Why else would you not be down there,

277
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,870
with a patrol unit making arrests,

278
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:10,956
unless you're involved?

279
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:13,848
All right.
We'll see what's going on.

280
00:17:28,034 --> 00:17:29,975
Satine, what are those
guards doing here?

281
00:17:30,628 --> 00:17:33,172
- Did you order them here?
Duchess, I've been with you

282
00:17:33,297 --> 00:17:34,688
the whole time.

283
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:39,526
Guards, let us into this warehouse.

284
00:17:39,782 --> 00:17:42,153
We're under strict orders
not to let anyone in.

285
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:44,049
Do you know who this is?

286
00:17:44,174 --> 00:17:46,825
I command you,
open these doors.

287
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:54,043
Arrest them!

288
00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:02,382
Hold it right there.

289
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:12,202
Impressive shooting for a senator.

290
00:19:21,462 --> 00:19:24,709
Captain, I want you to burn
down this warehouse.

291
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:26,174
Excuse me?

292
00:19:26,342 --> 00:19:29,359
- But there's evidence--
- Burn it down, or I'll consider you

293
00:19:29,484 --> 00:19:31,513
a part of this conspiracy, captain.

294
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:34,903
You heard her, men.
Burn the warehouse.

295
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:00,750
It wasn't death watch,
Prime minister.

296
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:03,069
It was a group of black
market Smugglers.

297
00:20:03,194 --> 00:20:05,298
They were diluting the
drink with slabin.

298
00:20:05,423 --> 00:20:08,425
What they didn't count on was, the
process would make the drinks poisonous.

299
00:20:08,593 --> 00:20:10,343
And what about the sick children?

300
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:13,972
I ordered shipments of the antidote
for all the schools and hospitals.

301
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,660
I'm glad this is over.

302
00:20:15,785 --> 00:20:18,018
No, I'm afraid it's not over.

303
00:20:18,186 --> 00:20:20,414
The corruption we
witnessed is intolerable.

304
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:24,232
Payoffs, police unwilling to
comply, my government fooled...

305
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,609
How does this happen?

306
00:20:25,862 --> 00:20:28,528
I'm sorry. I'm setting up a
committee to look into it.

307
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:32,616
Children nearly died because
our government cannot be counted on.

308
00:20:32,784 --> 00:20:35,493
I assure you this will not
go unpunished.

309
00:20:35,743 --> 00:20:37,704
I'm counting on you, Almec.

310
00:20:44,622 --> 00:20:46,233
I'm troubled, padme.

311
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:49,132
You heard prime minster almec
say he'll investigate.

312
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,260
His heart is in the right place,
but this corruption...

313
00:20:52,428 --> 00:20:56,563
- You must have hope, satine.
- Hope will only go so far.

314
00:20:57,283 --> 00:21:00,739
The very people conducting this
investigation might be corrupt.

315
00:21:01,896 --> 00:21:05,882
Perhaps a jedi working undercover at
the academy could be of service to us

316
00:21:06,007 --> 00:21:07,692
And in more ways than one,

317
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,736
For if we lose our young,

318
00:21:09,904 --> 00:21:12,186
