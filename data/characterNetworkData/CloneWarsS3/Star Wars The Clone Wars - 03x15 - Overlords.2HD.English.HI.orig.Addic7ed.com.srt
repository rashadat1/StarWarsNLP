341
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:06,653
On your knees!

342
00:20:21,865 --> 00:20:25,541
And now you see who you truly are.

343
00:20:25,575 --> 00:20:31,223
Only the chosen one could
tame both my children.

344
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:32,896
I have taken your test.

345
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,737
Now fulfill your
promise and let us go.

346
00:20:35,771 --> 00:20:40,718
Ah, but first you must
understand the truth.

347
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:45,064
Now all of you, leave us.

348
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:47,270
Do not trust him.

349
00:20:47,305 --> 00:20:48,173
You think?

350
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:50,579
I said leave us.

351
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:58,035
Do you feel your destiny?

352
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,542
You must see it now.

353
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:05,390
I am dying, and you must replace me.

354
00:21:05,424 --> 00:21:06,893
Replace you?

355
00:21:06,928 --> 00:21:08,799
I can't stay here.

356
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,872
But this is yours.

357
00:21:10,906 --> 00:21:12,745
It has been foretold.

358
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:17,925
The chosen one will remain to
keep my children in balance.

359
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,099
No.

360
00:21:20,134 --> 00:21:24,545
I cannot force you to do this.

361
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:27,286
The choice must be yours.

362
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:33,772
But leave and your selfishness
shall haunt you and the galaxy.

363
00:21:40,325 --> 00:21:43,042
Ready to get out of here?
