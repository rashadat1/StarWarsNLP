1
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,413
Echo Three to Echo Seven.

2
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,415
Han, old buddy,
do you read me?

3
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,417
<i>Loud and clear, kid.</i>
<i>What's up?</i>

4
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:40,474
I finished
my circle.

5
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,248
I don't pick up
any life readings.

6
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,187
<i>There isn't enough life</i>
<i>on this ice cube...</i>

7
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,690
<i>to fill a space cruiser.</i>

8
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,589
<i>Sensors are placed.</i>
<i>I'm going back.</i>

9
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,423
Right.
I'll see you shortly.

10
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,395
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

11
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,898
I want to check it out.
It won't take long.

12
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,332
[Braying]

13
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,892
Steady, girl.
What's the matter?

14
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,996
You smell something?

15
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,370
Rrraaah!

16
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,947
Chewie!

17
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,415
Chewie?

18
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,781
Chewie!

19
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,447
All right!
Don't lose your temper.

20
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,718
I'll come right back
and give you a hand.

21
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,505
Solo?

22
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,878
No sign of life
out there, General.

23
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,280
The sensors are in place.

24
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,511
You'll know if anything
comes around.

25
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,177
Commander Skywalker
reported in yet?

26
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,484
No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

27
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,649
With all the meteor activity
in this system...

28
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,454
it's going to be difficult
to spot approaching ships.

29
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,791
General, I got to leave.
I can't stay anymore.

30
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:30,886
I'm sorry to hear that.

31
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,123
Well, there's
a price on my head.

32
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,631
If I don't pay off
Jabba the Hutt...

33
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,962
I'm a dead man.

34
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,161
A death mark's
not an easy thing to live with.

35
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,669
You're a good fighter, Solo.

36
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,763
I hate to lose you.

37
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,740
Thank you, General.

38
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:52,880
Well, Your Highness,
guess this is it.

39
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,886
That's right.

40
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:58,412
Well, don't get
all mushy on me.

41
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,152
So long, Princess.

42
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,992
Han!

43
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,998
Yes, Your Highnessness?

44
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,125
I thought you had
decided to stay.

45
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,193
Well, the bounty hunter
we ran into in Ord Mantell...

46
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,202
changed my mind.

47
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,330
Han, we need you!

48
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,339
<i>We</i> need?

49
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:16,500
Yes.

50
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,508
Well, what about
<i>you</i> need?

51
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,669
<i>I</i> need?

52
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,009
I don't know what
you're talking about.

53
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,877
You probably don't.

54
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,746
And what precisely
am I supposed to know?

55
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,648
Come on!

56
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,017
You want me to stay
because of the way you feel about me.

57
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,783
Yes! You're
a great help to us.

58
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:31,789
You're a natural leader.

59
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,486
No! That's not it.

60
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,993
Come on.

61
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,427
A-ha!

62
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,021
You're imagining things.

63
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,895
Am I? Then why are
you following me?

64
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,902
Afraid I was gonna leave
without giving you a good-bye kiss?

65
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,403
I'd just as soon
kiss a Wookiee!

66
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,904
I can arrange that.

67
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,964
You could use
a good kiss!

68
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:53,406
I didn't ask you to turn on
the thermal heater.

69
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,915
I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess's chamber.

70
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,417
How will we
dry out her clothes?

71
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,417
<i>[Beep Beep]</i>

72
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,078
Oh, switch off!

73
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,520
Why did you
take this apart now?

74
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,352
I'm trying to get us out of here,
and you pull both...

75
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,824
Excuse me, sir.

76
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:07,951
Put them
back together now!

77
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:08,891
Might I have a word
with you, please?

78
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:09,893
What do you want?

79
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,054
Well, it's Princess Leia, sir.

80
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,062
She's been trying to get you
on the communicator.

81
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,063
I turned it off.

82
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,895
I don't want
to talk to her.

83
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,935
Well, Princess Leia is wondering
about Master Luke.

84
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:17,935
He hasn't
come back yet.

85
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:18,936
She doesn't know
where he is.

86
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:19,937
I don't know
where he is.

87
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:20,973
Nobody knows
where he is.

88
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,405
What do you mean,
nobody knows?

89
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,409
- Well, uh, you see...
- Deck Officer!

90
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,910
- Deck Officer!
- Excuse me, sir, might I...

91
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:26,967
Yes, sir?

92
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,411
Do you know where
Commander Skywalker is?

93
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,914
I haven't seen him.

94
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,449
It's possible he came through
the south entrance.

95
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:32,449
It's <i>possible?</i>

96
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,179
Why don't you
go find out?

97
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,311
It's getting
dark out there.

98
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,685
Yes, sir.

99
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,917
Excuse me, sir.
Might I inquire what's going on?

100
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,219
Why not?

101
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,419
Impossible man.

102
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:42,927
Come along, R2,
let's find Princess Leia.

103
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,189
Between ourselves...

104
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,891
I think Master Luke is
in considerable danger.

105
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,491
[Braying]

106
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,671
Sir, Commander Skywalker
hasn't come in the south entrance.

107
00:07:58,744 --> 00:07:59,870
He might have
forgotten to check in.

108
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,311
Not likely.
Are the speeders ready?

109
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,507
Uh, not yet. We're having trouble
adapting them to the cold.

110
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,743
We'll have to go out
on tauntauns.

111
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,580
Sir, the temperature's
dropping too rapidly.

112
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,950
That's right,
and my friend's out in it.

113
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,821
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.

114
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,920
Then I'll see you
in hell. Hyah!

115
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,979
Rrraaah!

116
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:51,222

00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,780

There's really
nothing more we can do.

121
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,929

are freezing up.

Of course we'll see
Master Luke again.

125
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,437
And he'll be quite
all right.

126
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:40,437
You'll see.

127
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,406
Stupid little short circuit.

128
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,568

Still no contact
from Skywalker or Solo.

133
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:52,838
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals...

134
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,745
although he does admit
that his own range is far too weak...

135
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,180
to abandon all hope.

136
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,080
Your Highness, there's nothing more
we can do tonight.

137
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,449

must be closed.

138
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:03,754
Close the doors.

00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:04,755

00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:46,237
Captain Solo,
do you copy?

182
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,918
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

183
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,455
This is Rogue Two.

184
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,956
Han: <i>Good morning.</i>

185
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,424
<i>Nice of you guys</i>
<i>to drop by.</i>

186
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,893
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.

187
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,396
I've found them.

188
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,295
Repeat, I've found them.

189
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:41,226
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

190
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,232
<i>[Beep Blip]</i>

191
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,064
R2 expresses
his relief also.

192
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,934
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.

193
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,439
You look strong enough...

194
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,441
to pull the ears
off a gundark.

195
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,942
Thanks to you.

196
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,639
That's two
you owe me, junior.

197
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,305
Well, Your Worship...

198
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,249
looks like you managed to keep me
around for a little while longer.

199
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,910
I had nothing
to do with it.

200
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,783
General Rieekan
thinks it's dangerous...

201
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,049
for any ships
to leave the system...

202
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,488
until we've activated
the energy field.

203
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,491
That's a good story.

204
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,787
<i>I</i> think you just can't bear...

205
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,523
to let a gorgeous guy like me
out of your sight.

206
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,930
I don't know where you get
your delusions, laser brain.

207
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,695
Hah hah hah!

208
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,937
Laugh it up, fuzzball...

209
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:23,441
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.

210
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,000
She expressed her
true feelings for me.

211
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,443
My...

212
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:30,505
Why, you stuck-up,
half-witted...

213
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,176
scruffy-looking
nerf herder!

214
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,346
Who's scruffy-looking?

215
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,952
I must have hit
pretty close to the mark...

216
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,085
to get her all riled up
like that, huh, kid?

217
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:50,024
Well, I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

218
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,441
<i>Headquarters personnel,</i>
<i>report to command center.</i>

219
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,477
<i>Headquarters personnel,</i>
<i>report to command center.</i>

220
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,574
Take it easy.

221
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,051
Excuse us,
please.

222
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,084
Princess,
we have a visitor.

223
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,855
Picked up something outside
the base's Zone 12 moving east.

224
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,089
It's metal.

225
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,152
Then it couldn't be
one of those creatures.

226
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,079
Could be a speeder,
one of ours.

227
00:18:20,114 --> 00:18:20,927
Could be a speeder,
one of ours.

228
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,261
No.

229
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,426
Wait.

230
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,164
There's something
very weak coming through.

231
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:29,401
[Radio Static]

232
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,603
Sir, I'm fluent in six million
forms of communication.

233
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,442
This signal is not used
by the Alliance.

234
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,607
It could be
an imperial code.

235
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,850
It isn't friendly,
whatever it is.

236
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,855
Come on, Chewie,
let's check it out.

237
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:48,188
Send Rogues 10 and 11
to Station 38.

238
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,671
Grrr!

239
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,288
Gahhh!

240
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,390
<i>I'm afraid</i>
<i>there's not much left.</i>

241
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,395
What was it?

242
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,931
<i>Droid of some kind.</i>

243
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,933
<i>I didn't hit it that hard.</i>
<i>Must've had a self-destruct.</i>

244
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,798
An imperial probe droid.

245
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,895
<i>It's a good bet the Empire</i>
<i>knows we're here.</i>

246
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,963
We'd better start
the evacuation.

247
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,149
Admiral.

248
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,654
Yes, Captain?

249
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,952
I think we've got
something, sir.

250
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,117
The report
is only a fragment...

251
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,785
from a probe droid
in the Hoth system...

252
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,328
but it's the best lead we've had.

253
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,263
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.

254
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,459
I want proof,
not leads.

255
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,468
The visuals indicate
life readings.

256
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:38,468
It could mean anything.

257
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,868
If we followed up
every lead...

258
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,303
But, sir...

259
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,965
the Hoth system is supposed to be
devoid of humans.

260
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,269
You've found something?

261
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,469
Yes, my lord.

262
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,245
That's it.
The rebels are there.

263
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:54,809
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

264
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:55,818
It could be smugglers...

265
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,718
That is the system.

266
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,223
And I'm sure Skywalker
is with them.

267
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:03,318
Set your course
for the Hoth system.

268
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,625
General Veers,
prepare your men.

269
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,130
Admiral.

270
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,166
Groups 7 and 10 will stay behind
to fly the speeders.

271
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:17,833
As soon as each transport is loaded...

272
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,070
evacuation control will give clearance
for immediate launch.

273
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,134
Right, sir.

274
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,343
All right!
That's it.

275
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,476
Try it.

276
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,416
Oh! Turn it off!
Turn it off!

277
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,686
Turn it off!

278
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,457
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47s.

279
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,462
Forget
the heavy equipment.

280
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:40,759
There's plenty of time...

281
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,459
to get the smaller modules
on the transports.

282
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:43,466
Take care, sir.

283
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:44,524
Thanks.

284
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,702
Chewie, take care
of yourself, OK?

285
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,146
OK, OK!

286
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,183
Hi, kid.

287
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,343
There's got to be
a reason for it.

288
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,818
Check it
at the other end.

289
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,081
Wait a second.

290
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,621
You all right?

291
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,022
Yeah.

292
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,730
Be careful.

293
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,564
You, too.

294
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,475
General, there's a fleet
of Stardestroyers...

295
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,479
coming out of hyperspace
in Sector Four.

296
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:31,482
Reroute all power
to the energy shield.

297
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,485
We gotta hold them till
all transports are away.

298
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,043
Prepare for ground assault.

299
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,969
What is it, General?

300
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,664
My lord, the fleet has moved out
of light speed.

301
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,934
ComScan has detected
an energy field...

302
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,441
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.

303
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,172
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

304
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,942
The rebels are alerted
to our presence.

305
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,950
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

306
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,952
He... He felt surprise
was wiser.

307
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,545
He is as clumsy
as he is stupid.

308
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:14,956
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

309
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:16,516
Yes, my lord.

310
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,127
Lord Vader.

311
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,467
The fleet has moved out of light speed,
and we're preparing to...

312
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,200
Aaugh!

313
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:32,971
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

314
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:34,272
Captain Piett.

315
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:35,973
Yes, my lord?

316
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:39,073
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field...

317
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:42,143
and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.

318
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,485
You are in command now,
Admiral Piett.

319
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:46,990
Thank you,
Lord Vader.

320
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:48,548
[Gagging]

321
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,921
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

322
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,795
The heavy transport ships will leave
as soon as they're loaded.

323
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:57,061
Only two fighter escorts
per ship.

324
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,899
The energy shield can only be opened
for a short time...

325
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,439
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.

326
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,941
Two fighters against
a Stardestroyer?

327
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,444
The ion cannon
will fire several shots...

328
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:10,538
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

329
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,742
When you've gotten past
the energy shield...

330
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,945
proceed directly
to the rendezvous point.

331
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,453
Understood?

332
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:17,954
Good luck.

333
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,957
OK Everybody
to your stations.

334
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,253
Let's go.

335
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:41,744
Their primary target will be
the power generators.

336
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,440
Prepare to open shield.

337
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,485
Sir, rebel ships are
coming into our sector.

338
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,649
Good. Our first catch
of the day.

339
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,294
Stand by, ion control.

340
00:24:58,797 --> 00:24:59,821
Fire.

341
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:18,146
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

342
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:21,652
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

343
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,359
Feeling all right, sir?

344
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,190
Just like new, Dak.
How about you?

345
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:34,357
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

346
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,593
I know what you mean.

347
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,080
Echo Station
Three-T-Eight.

348
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,917
We've spotted
imperial walkers.

349
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,287
<i>Imperial walkers</i>
<i>on the north ridge.</i>

350
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:03,885
[Thudding]

351
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,247
Echo Station Five-Seven.
We're on our way.

352
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,647
All right, boys,
keep tight now.

353
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,919
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

354
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,483
Steady, Dak.

355
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:38,461
Attack pattern Delta.
Go now.

356
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,895
All right.
I'm coming in.

00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,534
Hobbie,
you still with me?

358
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,324
That armor's too strong
for blasters.

359
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,965
Rogue Group,
use your harpoons and tow cables.

360
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:22,837
Go for the legs. It might be
our only chance of stopping them.

361
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,875
All right.
Stand by, Dak.

362
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:27,810
Oh, Luke, we've got a malfunction
in fire control.

363
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,904
I'll have to cut in
the auxiliary.

364
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,609
Just hang on.
Hang on, Dak.

365
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,845
Get ready to fire
that tow cable.

366
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,011
Ah!

367
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,214
Dak?

368
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,350
Dak!

369
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:08,308
Yes, Lord Vader, I've reached
the main power generators.

370
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:09,876
The shield will be down
in moments.

371
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:12,684
You may start your landing.

00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,930
Wedge, I've lost my gunner.

375
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,330
You'll have to
make this shot.

376
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,163
I'll cover for you.

377
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:27,727
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.

378
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,774
Coming around,

379
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,010
Steady, Rogue Two.

Activate harpoon.

381
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,675
Good shot, Janson.

382
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:49,024
- One more pass.
- Coming around, Wedge.

383
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,864
Cable out.
Let her go!

384
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,800
Detach cable.

385
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,064
Cable detached.

386
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,574
Come on.

387

Hah! That got him!

388
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,987
I see it, Wedge.
Good work.

389
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,385
I don't think...

390
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:22,756
we can protect
two transports at a time.

391
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:24,920
It's risky, but we can't
hold out much longer.

392
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:27,430
We have no choice.

393
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:28,431

394
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,400
Evacuate remaining ground staff.

No, no! No.

This one goes there.

00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,803
That one goes there, right?

399
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:42,813

of Master Luke now, understand?

Why are you

Heard the command center had been hit.

Don't worry. I'll leave.

First I'm gonna
get you to your ship.

Yeah,

Excuse me, ma'am,
but where are we going?

Our ships have sighted
the <i>Millennium Falcon,</i> lord...

00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:45,741
but it has entered an asteroid field,
and we cannot risk...

Asteroids do not
concern me, Admiral.

Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask,
but does that include shutting me down, too?

00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:07,934
No. I need you to talk
to the <i>Falcon.</i>

596
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:11,099
Find out what's wrong
with the hyperdrive.

Sir, it's quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable.

Not entirely stable?

I'm glad you're here
to tell us these things.

Chewie, take the professor
in the back...

the hyperdrive.

understand human behavior.

is find this Yoda...

It's really a strange place
to find a Jedi master.

This place
gives me the creeps.

to land in that puddle.

our ship out, we would.

Oh. Jedi master. Yoda.

Oh! Where is R2
when I need him?

684
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:12,967
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate...

685
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,738
but it has the most
peculiar dialect.

686
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:16,870
I believe, sir, it says
that the power coupling...

687
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:18,380
on the negative axis
has been polarized.

688
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:20,973
I'm afraid you'll have
to replace it.

689
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:24,316
Well, of course I'll
have to replace it.

690
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:25,912
Here!

691
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:27,752
And, Chewie...

692
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:32,087
I think we'd better replace
the negative power coupling.

693
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:57,142
Hey, Your Worship,
I'm only trying to help.

694

Would you please
stop calling me that?

00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:01,783
Sure, Leia.

696
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:03,917
You make it
so difficult sometimes.

697
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:05,962
I do. I really do.

698
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:08,964
You could be a little nicer, though.

699
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:11,933
Come on, admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.

700
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:15,937
Occasionally... maybe...

701
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:18,600
when you aren't acting
like a scoundrel.

702
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:20,472
Scoundrel?

703
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:22,068
Scoundrel?

704
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,941
I like the sound
of that.

705
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:27,915
Stop that.

706
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:29,747
Stop what?

707
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,913
Stop that.
My hands are dirty.

708
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:34,422
My hands are dirty, too.
What are you afraid of?

709
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:35,685
Afraid?

710
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,693
You're trembling.

711
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,456
I'm not trembling.

712
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:43,727
You like me because
I'm a scoundrel.

713
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,859
There aren't enough
scoundrels in your life.

714
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,461
I happen to like nice men.

715
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:49,527
I'm a nice man.

716
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,335
No, you're not. You're...

717
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,070
Sir, sir!

718
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:57,841
I've isolated
the reverse power flux coupling.

719
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,312
Thank you.

720
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:02,783
Thank you very much.

721
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,616
Oh, you're perfectly
welcome, sir.

722
00:52:10,693 --> 00:52:13,992
And that was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes.

723
00:52:14,063 --> 00:52:15,621
Considering the amount of
damage we've sustained...

724
00:52:15,698 --> 00:52:16,926
they must have been
destroyed.

725
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,764
No, Captain.
They're alive.

726
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:21,804
I want every ship
available...

727
00:52:21,871 --> 00:52:23,463
to sweep
the asteroid field...

728
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,802
until they are found.

729
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:30,176
Lord Vader.

730
00:52:30,246 --> 00:52:32,180
Yes, Admiral.
What is it?

731
00:52:32,248 --> 00:52:33,681
The emperor
commands you...

732
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,183
to make contact
with him.

733
00:52:35,251 --> 00:52:37,116
Move the ship out of
the asteroid field...

734
00:52:37,186 --> 00:52:40,121
so that we can send
a clear transmission.

735
00:52:40,189 --> 00:52:41,679
Yes, my lord.

736
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:00,635
What is thy bidding,
my master?

737
00:53:01,844 --> 00:53:04,836
There is a great
disturbance in the Force.

738
00:53:04,914 --> 00:53:06,779
I have felt it.

739
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:09,283
We have
a new enemy...

740
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,616
Luke Skywalker.

741
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,451
Yes, my master.

742
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,650
He could destroy us.

743
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:17,625
He's just a boy.

744
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,822
Obi-Wan can no longer
help him.

745
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:23,593
The Force
is strong with him.

746
00:53:23,666 --> 00:53:25,725
The son of Skywalker...

747
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:29,101
must not become a Jedi.

748
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:31,265
If he could be turned...

749
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:34,139
he would become
a powerful ally.

750
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,336
Yes.

751
00:53:35,411 --> 00:53:37,606
Yes.

752
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,843
He would be
a great asset.

753
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:42,680
Can it be done?

754
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:46,188
He will join us
or die, master.

755
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,205
Look,
I'm sure it's delicious.

756
00:54:05,274 --> 00:54:08,209
I just don't understand
why we can't see Yoda now.

757
00:54:08,277 --> 00:54:09,209
Patience!

758
00:54:09,278 --> 00:54:10,711
For the Jedi...

759
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,611
it is time
to eat as well.

760
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:14,616
Hmm? Heh heh.

761
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:17,881
Eat, eat.

762
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:19,046
Hot!

763
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:28,755
Good food!
Mmm, good, hmm?

764
00:54:28,831 --> 00:54:31,925
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

765
00:54:32,001 --> 00:54:33,730
Not far.
Yoda not far.

766
00:54:33,803 --> 00:54:37,034
Patience. Soon you
will be with him.

767
00:54:39,475 --> 00:54:41,102
Root leaf.

768
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:42,576
I cook.

769
00:54:42,645 --> 00:54:47,082
Why wish you
become Jedi? Hmm? Hmm?

770
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,311
Mostly because of
my father, I guess.

771
00:54:49,385 --> 00:54:50,647
Ah, father.

772
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,154
Powerful Jedi was he.

773
00:54:53,222 --> 00:54:55,156
Hee hee.
Mmm, powerful Jedi.

774
00:54:55,224 --> 00:54:56,919
Oh, come on.

775
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:58,483
How could you
know my father?

776
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:00,324
You don't
even know who I am.

777
00:55:00,396 --> 00:55:02,330
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

778
00:55:02,398 --> 00:55:04,195
We're wasting our time!

779
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:07,133
I cannot teach him.

780
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:09,637
The boy
has no patience.

781
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:12,368
<i>He will learn patience.</i>

782
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:13,534
Hmm...

783
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:19,604
Much anger in him...

784
00:55:19,682 --> 00:55:21,616
like his father.

785
00:55:21,684 --> 00:55:25,450
<i>Was I any different</i>
<i>when you taught me?</i>

786
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,620
No.

787
00:55:28,691 --> 00:55:30,591
He is not ready.

788
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,957
Yoda.

789
00:55:34,163 --> 00:55:35,562
I am ready.

790
00:55:35,631 --> 00:55:37,929
Ben...
I can be a Jedi.

791
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,968
Ben, tell him I'm...

792
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:41,469
Ready, are you?

793
00:55:41,537 --> 00:55:43,869
What know you ready?

794
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:47,341
For 800 years
have I trained Jedi.

795
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:49,970
My own counsel will I keep...

796
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:52,913
on who is to be trained.

797
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:57,646
A Jedi must have
the deepest commitment, hmm?

798
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,620
The most serious mind.

799
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:05,453
This one a long time
have I watched.

800
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:08,554
All his life
has he looked away...

801
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:11,725
to the future,
to the horizon.

802
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:15,396
Never his mind
on where he was...

803
00:56:15,471 --> 00:56:16,597
hmm?

804
00:56:16,672 --> 00:56:18,640
What he was doing.

805
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,300
Hmph!

806
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:21,468
Adventure.

807
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,636
Ha!

808
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,145
Excitement. Ha!

809
00:56:24,213 --> 00:56:26,841
A Jedi craves
not these things.

810
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:29,612
You are reckless!

811
00:56:29,685 --> 00:56:32,677
<i>So was I,</i>
<i>if you remember.</i>

812
00:56:32,755 --> 00:56:35,690
He is too old.

813
00:56:35,758 --> 00:56:38,488
Yes, too old to
begin the training.

814
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:41,086
But I've learned so much.

815
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,962
Ahh...

816
00:56:47,503 --> 00:56:50,438
Will he finish
what he begins?

817
00:56:50,506 --> 00:56:52,167
I won't fail you.

818
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,371
I'm not afraid.

819
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,141
Oh...

820
00:56:59,715 --> 00:57:01,649
You will be.

821
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:05,145
You will be.

822
00:57:44,741 --> 00:57:46,174
[Squealing]

823
00:57:46,243 --> 00:57:47,540
Aah!

824
00:57:47,611 --> 00:57:49,579
Sir, if I may venture
an opinion...

825
00:57:49,646 --> 00:57:51,637
I'm not really interested
in your opinion.

826
00:57:51,715 --> 00:57:53,046
There's something
out there.

827
00:57:53,116 --> 00:57:54,310
Where?

828
00:57:54,384 --> 00:57:55,373
Outside in the cave.

829
00:57:55,452 --> 00:57:56,976
[Banging]

830
00:57:57,054 --> 00:57:58,453
There it is.
Listen. Listen!

831
00:57:58,522 --> 00:57:59,546
I'm going out there.

832
00:57:59,623 --> 00:58:00,612
Are you crazy?

833
00:58:00,691 --> 00:58:02,090
I just got this bucket
back together.

834
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:04,286
I'm not going to let
something tear it apart.

835
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:06,090
Then I'm going
with you.

836
00:58:06,163 --> 00:58:07,790
I think it might
be better...

837
00:58:07,864 --> 00:58:09,991
- if I stay behind and guard the ship.
- [Roar]

838
00:58:10,067 --> 00:58:10,999
Oh, no.

839
00:58:24,948 --> 00:58:28,213
Leia: This ground
sure feels strange.

840
00:58:28,285 --> 00:58:30,776
It doesn't
feel like rock.

841
00:58:34,191 --> 00:58:37,718
Han: There's an awful lot
of moisture in here.

842
00:58:37,794 --> 00:58:39,625
Leia: I don't know.

843
00:58:39,696 --> 00:58:42,722
I have a bad feeling
about this.

844
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:43,959
Yeah.

845
00:58:45,602 --> 00:58:46,569
Watch out!

846
00:58:47,771 --> 00:58:49,068
It's all right.

847
00:58:49,139 --> 00:58:50,197
It's all right.

848
00:58:50,273 --> 00:58:52,207
Yeah, that's what
I thought... mynock.

849
00:58:52,275 --> 00:58:54,072
Chewie, check the rest
of the ship...

850
00:58:54,144 --> 00:58:56,510
and make sure there are
no more attached...

851
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:58,844
chewing
on the power cables.

852
00:58:58,915 --> 00:59:00,212
Mynocks.

853
00:59:00,283 --> 00:59:02,547
Go on inside. We'll clean them off
if there are any more.

854
00:59:07,023 --> 00:59:08,786
Han!

855
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,090
Aagghh! Go away, go away,
beastly thing!

856
00:59:13,163 --> 00:59:14,187
Shoo! Shoo!

857
00:59:21,037 --> 00:59:22,971
Wait a minute...

858
00:59:44,728 --> 00:59:46,059
Let's get out of here!

859
00:59:46,129 --> 00:59:48,324
The Empire is still out there!
I don't think...

860
00:59:48,398 --> 00:59:50,628
No time to discuss this
in committee!

861
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,725
I'm not a committee!

862
00:59:58,708 --> 01:00:01,643
You can't make the jump to light speed
in this asteroid field.

863
01:00:01,711 --> 01:00:04,407
Sit down, sweetheart!
We're taking off!

864
01:00:08,185 --> 01:00:09,174
Look!

865
01:00:09,252 --> 01:00:10,583
I see it.
I see it.

866
01:00:10,654 --> 01:00:11,643

867
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:13,086
Leia: The cave is collapsing.

868
01:00:13,156 --> 01:00:15,090
- This is no cave.
- What?

869
01:00:47,924 --> 01:00:48,948
Run!

870
01:00:49,025 --> 01:00:52,893
Yes! A Jediís strength
flows from the Force.

871
01:00:52,963 --> 01:00:55,625
But beware
of the dark side.

872
01:00:55,699 --> 01:00:57,394
Anger, fear,
aggression...

873
01:00:57,467 --> 01:01:00,561
The dark side of
the Force are they...

874
01:01:00,637 --> 01:01:03,629
easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.

875
01:01:03,707 --> 01:01:06,471
If once you start down
the dark path...

876
01:01:06,543 --> 01:01:08,636
forever will it dominate
your destiny.

877
01:01:08,712 --> 01:01:10,145
Consume you it will...

878
01:01:10,213 --> 01:01:12,044
as it did Obi-Wan's
apprentice.

879
01:01:12,115 --> 01:01:13,548
Vader.

880
01:01:13,617 --> 01:01:15,847
Is the dark side
stronger?

881
01:01:15,919 --> 01:01:17,386
No, no.

882
01:01:17,454 --> 01:01:18,853
No.

883
01:01:18,922 --> 01:01:21,356
Quicker, easier,
more seductive.

884
01:01:21,424 --> 01:01:24,325
How do I know the good side
from the bad?

885
01:01:24,394 --> 01:01:27,659
You will know
when you are calm...

886
01:01:27,731 --> 01:01:29,665
at peace...

887
01:01:29,733 --> 01:01:31,394
passive.

888
01:01:31,468 --> 01:01:34,733
A Jedi
uses the Force...

889
01:01:34,804 --> 01:01:36,533
for knowledge
and defense...

890
01:01:36,606 --> 01:01:38,767
never for attack.

891
01:01:38,842 --> 01:01:39,866
But tell me why
I can't...

892
01:01:39,943 --> 01:01:42,070
No, no.
There is no why.

893
01:01:42,145 --> 01:01:44,909
Nothing more will I
teach you today.

894
01:01:44,981 --> 01:01:47,506
Clear your mind
of questions.

895
01:01:47,584 --> 01:01:51,350
Hmm...

896
01:01:51,421 --> 01:01:53,048
Mmm...

897
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:12,000
There's something
not right here.

898
01:02:15,645 --> 01:02:17,875

1082
01:16:43,145 --> 01:16:44,942
Hmm...

1083
01:16:45,014 --> 01:16:46,413
Control, control.

1084
01:16:46,482 --> 01:16:48,416
You must learn control!

<i>[Beep Beep]</i>

1086
01:16:50,386 --> 01:16:54,720
I saw... I saw a city
in the clouds.

1087
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:56,280
Hmm...

1088
01:16:56,358 --> 01:16:58,952
Friends you have there.

1089
01:16:59,028 --> 01:17:01,053
They were in pain.

1090
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:04,497
It is the future you see.

1091
01:17:04,567 --> 01:17:05,898
Future?

1092
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:16,310
Will they die?

1093
01:17:19,215 --> 01:17:20,910
Difficult to see.

1094
01:17:20,983 --> 01:17:24,248
Always in motion
is the future.

1095
01:17:25,321 --> 01:17:28,154
I've got to go to them.

1096
01:17:29,658 --> 01:17:32,593
Decide you must
how to serve them best.

1097
01:17:32,661 --> 01:17:35,357
If you leave now,
help them you could...

1098
01:17:35,431 --> 01:17:37,422
but you would destroy all...

1099
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:40,833
for which they have
fought and suffered.

1100
01:17:54,016 --> 01:17:57,474
No, I don't have
a landing permit.

1101
01:17:57,553 --> 01:18:01,455
I'm trying to reach
Lando Calrissian.

1102
01:18:01,524 --> 01:18:03,685
Wait a minute!
Let me explain!

1103
01:18:03,759 --> 01:18:05,226
<i>You will not deviate</i>
<i>from your present course.</i>

1104
01:18:05,294 --> 01:18:06,852
aren't they?

1105
01:18:06,929 --> 01:18:08,624
I thought
you knew this person.

1106
01:18:08,697 --> 01:18:10,631
Gaah!

1107
01:18:10,699 --> 01:18:12,564
That was
a long time ago.

1108
01:18:12,635 --> 01:18:14,330
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.

1109
01:18:21,877 --> 01:18:26,541
<i>Permission granted to land</i>

1110
01:18:26,615 --> 01:18:28,105
Thank you.

1111
01:18:28,183 --> 01:18:30,117
Nothing
to worry about.

1112
01:18:30,185 --> 01:18:31,846
We go way back,
Lando and me.

1113
01:18:31,921 --> 01:18:33,650
Who's worried?

1114
01:19:06,822 --> 01:19:09,416

1115
01:19:09,491 --> 01:19:11,459
I don't like this.

1116
01:19:11,527 --> 01:19:13,961
Well, what
would you like?

1117
01:19:14,029 --> 01:19:16,463
They <i>did</i> let us land.

1118
01:19:16,532 --> 01:19:18,466
Look, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

1119
01:19:18,534 --> 01:19:19,933
Trust me.

1120
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:26,906
See? My friend.

1121
01:19:31,146 --> 01:19:33,740
Keep your eyes
open, huh?

1122
01:19:33,816 --> 01:19:35,750
Gahhh!

1123
01:19:35,818 --> 01:19:37,308
Hey!

1124
01:19:37,386 --> 01:19:39,115
Why, you slimy...

1125
01:19:39,188 --> 01:19:42,521
double-crossing,
no-good swindler.

1126
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:45,116
You've got a lot of guts coming here...

1127
01:19:45,194 --> 01:19:46,855
after what you pulled.

1128
01:19:54,737 --> 01:19:57,262
Ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha!

1129
01:19:57,339 --> 01:20:00,831
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!

1130
01:20:00,909 --> 01:20:04,003
Well, he seems
very friendly.

1131
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:05,068
Yes.

1132
01:20:05,147 --> 01:20:07,206
Very friendly.

1133
01:20:07,282 --> 01:20:08,715
What are you doing here?

1134
01:20:08,784 --> 01:20:11,116
Ah, repairs.
I thought you could help me out.

1135
01:20:11,186 --> 01:20:13,245
What have you done
to my ship?

1136
01:20:13,322 --> 01:20:14,254
Your ship?

1137
01:20:14,323 --> 01:20:15,312
Hey, remember...

1138
01:20:15,391 --> 01:20:17,518
you lost her to me
fair and square.

1139
01:20:17,593 --> 01:20:19,788
And how you doin',
Chewbacca?

1140
01:20:19,862 --> 01:20:21,022
Gahh!

1141
01:20:21,096 --> 01:20:22,529
You still hanging around
with this loser?

1142
01:20:22,598 --> 01:20:25,294
Gahhh!

1143
01:20:25,367 --> 01:20:27,733
Hello.
What have we here?

1144
01:20:27,803 --> 01:20:29,134
Welcome,
I'm Lando Calrissian.

1145
01:20:29,204 --> 01:20:32,037
I'm the administrator
of this facility.

1146
01:20:32,107 --> 01:20:34,007
And who might you be?

1147
01:20:34,076 --> 01:20:35,236
Leia.

1148
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:36,902
Welcome, Leia.

1149
01:20:40,015 --> 01:20:43,451
All right, all right,
you old smoothie.

1150
01:20:43,519 --> 01:20:46,955
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

1151
01:20:47,022 --> 01:20:48,512
My facilities
are at your...

1152
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:49,921
Well, really!

1153
01:20:49,992 --> 01:20:51,892
What's wrong
with the <i>Falcon?</i>

1154
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:53,222
Hyperdrive.

1155
01:20:53,295 --> 01:20:55,229
I'll get my people
to work on her.

1156
01:20:55,297 --> 01:20:56,992
That ship saved my life
quite a few times.

1157
01:20:57,066 --> 01:21:00,001
She's the fastest
hunk of junk in the galaxy.

1158
01:21:00,069 --> 01:21:03,232
How's the gas mine?
Still paying off for you?

1159
01:21:03,305 --> 01:21:04,704
Not as well as I'd like.

1160
01:21:04,773 --> 01:21:06,968
We're a small outpost
and not very self-sufficient.

1161
01:21:07,042 --> 01:21:08,475
I've had supply problems
of every kind.

1162
01:21:08,544 --> 01:21:09,977
I've had labor difficulties.

1163
01:21:10,045 --> 01:21:11,706
Ha ha ha!

1164
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:13,372
What's so funny?

1165
01:21:13,449 --> 01:21:14,973
You. Listen to you.

1166
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:17,109
You sound like
a businessman...

1167
01:21:17,186 --> 01:21:18,619
a responsible leader.

1168
01:21:18,687 --> 01:21:20,917
Who'd have
thought that, huh?

1169
01:21:20,989 --> 01:21:23,583
Seeing you brings back
a few things.

1170
01:21:23,659 --> 01:21:24,751
Yeah.

1171
01:21:24,827 --> 01:21:26,624
Yeah, I'm responsible
these days.

1172
01:21:26,695 --> 01:21:28,720
It's the price you pay...

1173
01:21:28,797 --> 01:21:30,731
for being successful.

1174
01:21:33,001 --> 01:21:35,492
Ooh. Nice to see
a familiar face.

1175
01:21:35,571 --> 01:21:37,004
<i>E chu ta!</i>

1176
01:21:37,072 --> 01:21:38,505
How rude!

1177
01:21:38,574 --> 01:21:40,007
<i>[Beep Beep]</i>

1178
01:21:40,075 --> 01:21:42,009
That sounds like
an R2 unit in there.

1179
01:21:42,077 --> 01:21:43,567
I wonder if... Hello?

1180
01:21:43,645 --> 01:21:45,237
Hello?

1181
01:21:45,314 --> 01:21:46,747
How interesting.

1182
01:21:46,815 --> 01:21:48,442
Who are you?

1183
01:21:48,517 --> 01:21:49,950
Oh, my! I...
I'm terribly sorry.

1184
01:21:50,018 --> 01:21:51,542
I didn't mean
to intrude.

1185
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:52,746
No, please don't get up.

1186
01:21:59,194 --> 01:22:00,661
Gahhh.

1187
01:22:11,173 --> 01:22:13,801
Luke, you must complete
the training.

1188
01:22:13,876 --> 01:22:15,571
I can't keep the vision
out of my head.

1189
01:22:15,644 --> 01:22:17,669
They're my friends.
I got to help them.

1190
01:22:17,746 --> 01:22:19,941
You must not go.

1191
01:22:20,015 --> 01:22:23,143
But Han and Leia will die
if I don't.

1192
01:22:23,218 --> 01:22:24,810
<i>You don't know that.</i>

1193
01:22:24,887 --> 01:22:27,788
<i>Even Yoda cannot</i>
<i>see their fate.</i>

1194
01:22:27,856 --> 01:22:30,017
But I can help them.

1195
01:22:30,092 --> 01:22:31,616
I feel the Force.

1196
01:22:31,693 --> 01:22:33,160
<i>But you cannot</i>
<i>control it.</i>

1197
01:22:33,228 --> 01:22:35,788
<i>This is a dangerous</i>
<i>time for you...</i>

1198
01:22:35,864 --> 01:22:39,664
<i>when you will be tempted</i>
<i>by the dark side of the Force.</i>

1199
01:22:39,735 --> 01:22:43,000
Yes! Yes!
To Obi-Wan you listen.

1200
01:22:43,071 --> 01:22:46,165
The cave.
Remember your failure at the cave.

1201
01:22:46,241 --> 01:22:49,540
But I've learned
so much since then.

1202
01:22:49,611 --> 01:22:53,047
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and to finish what I've begun.

1203
01:22:53,115 --> 01:22:54,446
You have my word.

1204
01:22:54,516 --> 01:22:55,949
<i>It is you</i>
<i>and your abilities...</i>

1205
01:22:56,018 --> 01:22:57,315
<i>the emperor wants.</i>

1206
01:22:57,386 --> 01:23:01,288
<i>That is why your friends</i>
<i>are made to suffer.</i>

1207
01:23:01,356 --> 01:23:03,324
That's why
I have to go.

1208
01:23:03,392 --> 01:23:06,725
<i>Luke, I don't want</i>
<i>to lose you to the emperor...</i>

1209
01:23:06,795 --> 01:23:08,786
<i>the way I lost Vader.</i>

1210
01:23:08,864 --> 01:23:10,388
You won't.

1211
01:23:10,465 --> 01:23:12,456
Stopped they must be.

1212
01:23:12,534 --> 01:23:14,866
On this all depends.

1213
01:23:14,937 --> 01:23:17,303
Only a fully trained
Jedi knight...

1214
01:23:17,372 --> 01:23:19,203
with the Force
as his ally...

1215
01:23:19,274 --> 01:23:21,902
will conquer Vader
and his emperor.

1216
01:23:21,977 --> 01:23:24,138
If you end
your training now...

1217
01:23:24,213 --> 01:23:28,547
if you choose the quick and easy path,
as Vader did...

1218
01:23:28,617 --> 01:23:31,313
you will become
an agent of evil.

1219
01:23:31,386 --> 01:23:32,375
<i>Patience.</i>

1220
01:23:32,454 --> 01:23:34,684
And sacrifice
Han and Leia?

1221
01:23:34,756 --> 01:23:38,852
If you honor what they fight for... yes.

1222
01:23:38,927 --> 01:23:40,588
<i>If you choose to face Vader...</i>

1223
01:23:40,662 --> 01:23:42,061
<i>you will do it alone.</i>

1224
01:23:42,130 --> 01:23:44,189
<i>I cannot interfere.</i>

1225
01:23:45,434 --> 01:23:47,493
I understand.

1226
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,302
R2.

1227
01:23:53,375 --> 01:23:54,808
<i>[Blip Beep]</i>

1228
01:23:54,877 --> 01:23:56,777
Fire up the converters.

1229
01:23:58,947 --> 01:24:00,005
<i>Luke!</i>

1230
01:24:00,082 --> 01:24:03,108
<i>Don't give in to hate.</i>

1231
01:24:03,185 --> 01:24:06,018
<i>That leads to the dark side.</i>

1232
01:24:06,088 --> 01:24:07,521
Strong is Vader.

1233
01:24:07,589 --> 01:24:10,456
Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.

1234
01:24:10,525 --> 01:24:12,015
I will.

1235
01:24:12,094 --> 01:24:13,857
And I'll return.

1236
01:24:13,929 --> 01:24:15,362
I promise.

1237
01:24:22,104 --> 01:24:24,072
Told you, I did.

1238
01:24:24,139 --> 01:24:25,868
Reckless is he.

1239
01:24:25,941 --> 01:24:27,033
Now...

1240
01:24:27,109 --> 01:24:28,906
matters are worse.

1241
01:24:28,977 --> 01:24:31,912
<i>That boy</i>
<i>is our last hope.</i>

1242
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:34,039
No, there is another.

1243
01:24:57,940 --> 01:24:59,305
The ship's almost finished.

1244
01:24:59,374 --> 01:25:01,638
Two or three more things
and we're in great shape.

1245
01:25:01,710 --> 01:25:03,337
The sooner the better.
Something is wrong here.

1246
01:25:03,412 --> 01:25:05,972
No one has seen or knows
anything about 3PO.

1247
01:25:06,048 --> 01:25:08,346
He's been gone too long
to have gotten lost.

1248
01:25:08,417 --> 01:25:10,851
Relax.
I'll talk to Lando...

1249
01:25:10,919 --> 01:25:13,353
and see what
I can find out.

1250
01:25:13,422 --> 01:25:15,356
I don't trust Lando.

1251
01:25:15,424 --> 01:25:17,858
Well, I don't
trust him either.

1252
01:25:17,926 --> 01:25:20,451
But he is my friend.
Besides...

1253
01:25:20,529 --> 01:25:22,463
we'll soon be gone.

1254
01:25:22,531 --> 01:25:25,864
Then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

1255
01:25:59,101 --> 01:26:00,568
Gaahh!

1256
01:26:00,635 --> 01:26:01,727
What happened?

1257
01:26:01,803 --> 01:26:03,361
Gahhh gahhh.

1258
01:26:03,438 --> 01:26:04,803
Where?

1259
01:26:04,873 --> 01:26:06,204
Gahhh!

1260
01:26:06,274 --> 01:26:08,174
Found him
in a junk pile?

1261
01:26:08,243 --> 01:26:11,007
Oh, what a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

1262
01:26:11,079 --> 01:26:13,047
Gahhh!

1263
01:26:13,115 --> 01:26:14,810
Lando's got people
that can fix him.

1264
01:26:14,883 --> 01:26:16,373
No, thanks.

1265
01:26:16,451 --> 01:26:20,114
I'm sorry, am I
interrupting anything?

1266
01:26:20,188 --> 01:26:22,179
Not really.

1267
01:26:25,627 --> 01:26:27,720
You look
absolutely beautiful.

1268
01:26:27,796 --> 01:26:31,163
You truly belong here
with us among the clouds.

1269
01:26:31,233 --> 01:26:32,700
Thank you.

1270
01:26:32,768 --> 01:26:35,703
Would you join me
for a little refreshment?

1271
01:26:35,771 --> 01:26:37,363
Everyone's invited,
of course.

1272
01:26:38,774 --> 01:26:40,674
Having trouble
with your droid?

1273
01:26:40,742 --> 01:26:42,209
No, no problem.

1274
01:26:42,277 --> 01:26:43,301
Why?

1275
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,818
You see, since we're
a small operation...

1276
01:26:53,889 --> 01:26:55,914
we don't fall into...

1277
01:26:55,991 --> 01:26:58,357
the jurisdiction
of the Empire.

1278
01:26:58,427 --> 01:27:01,362
So you're part of
the Mining Guild, then?

1279
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:03,330
No, not actually. Our operation
is small enough not to be noticed.

1280
01:27:03,398 --> 01:27:05,366
Which is advantageous
for everybody...

1281
01:27:05,434 --> 01:27:07,834
since our customers
are anxious to avoid...

1282
01:27:07,903 --> 01:27:10,064
attracting attention
to themselves.

1283
01:27:10,138 --> 01:27:12,606
Aren't you afraid
the Empire's going to find out...

1284
01:27:12,674 --> 01:27:14,539
about this little operation,
shut you down?

1285
01:27:14,609 --> 01:27:17,043
It's always been a danger that looms
like a shadow over everything we've built.

1286
01:27:17,112 --> 01:27:19,512
But things have developed
that'll ensure security.

1287
01:27:19,581 --> 01:27:24,450
I've just made a deal that will
keep the Empire out of here forever.

1288
01:27:33,428 --> 01:27:36,261
We would be honored
if you would join us.

1289
01:27:41,703 --> 01:27:43,136
I had no choice.

1290
01:27:43,205 --> 01:27:45,537
They arrived
right before you did.

1291
01:27:45,607 --> 01:27:47,097
I'm sorry.

1292
01:27:51,313 --> 01:27:52,974
I'm sorry, too.

1293
01:27:55,217 --> 01:27:57,048
Gahhh.

1295
01:28:08,463 --> 01:28:10,488

01:28:10,565 --> 01:28:12,726

Here?
We're in danger!

1306
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:26,664
I must
tell the others.

Aaaaahhh!

1311
01:29:55,971 --> 01:29:57,404
Lord Vader.

1312
01:29:57,472 --> 01:30:00,908
You may take Captain Solo
to Jabba the Hutt...

1313
01:30:00,976 --> 01:30:02,876
after I have Skywalker.

1314
01:30:02,944 --> 01:30:04,844
He's no good to me dead.

1315
01:30:04,913 --> 01:30:07,882
He will not be
permanently damaged.

1316
01:30:07,949 --> 01:30:10,076
Aaaahhh!

1317
01:30:10,151 --> 01:30:13,587
Lord Vader, what about Leia
and the Wookiee?

1318
01:30:13,655 --> 01:30:16,055
They must never again
leave this city.

1319
01:30:16,124 --> 01:30:17,682
That was never a condition
of our agreement...

1320
01:30:17,759 --> 01:30:19,386
nor was giving Han
to this bounty hunter.

1321
01:30:19,461 --> 01:30:24,660
Perhaps you think you're
being treated unfairly?

1322
01:30:24,733 --> 01:30:25,665
No.

1323
01:30:25,734 --> 01:30:27,201
Good. It would be
unfortunate...

1324
01:30:27,269 --> 01:30:30,864
if I had to leave
a garrison here.

1325
01:30:30,939 --> 01:30:35,308
This deal is getting worse all the time.

1326
01:30:36,511 --> 01:30:39,446
Oh, yes, that's very good.
I like that.

1327
01:30:39,514 --> 01:30:40,708
Oh!

1328
01:30:40,782 --> 01:30:43,410
Something's not right
because now I can't see.

1329
01:30:43,485 --> 01:30:47,615
Oh, oh, oh,
that's much better.

1330
01:30:47,689 --> 01:30:49,122
Wait! Wait!

1331
01:30:49,190 --> 01:30:51,124
Oh, my!
What have you done?

1332
01:30:51,192 --> 01:30:53,126
I'm backwards...

1333
01:30:53,194 --> 01:30:55,128
you flea-bitten
furball!

1334
01:30:55,196 --> 01:30:57,130
Only an overgrown
mophead like you...

1335
01:30:57,198 --> 01:30:58,859
would be
stupid enough...

1336
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:13,972
I feel terrible.

1337
01:31:14,049 --> 01:31:15,482
Gahhh.

1338
01:31:29,097 --> 01:31:31,497
Why are they
doing this?

1339
01:31:34,602 --> 01:31:38,003
They never even asked me
any questions.

1340
01:31:41,409 --> 01:31:43,001
Lando.

1341
01:31:45,747 --> 01:31:46,805
Grrr!

1342
01:31:46,881 --> 01:31:48,041
Han: Get out of here, Lando.

1343
01:31:48,116 --> 01:31:50,016
Shut up and listen!

1344
01:31:50,085 --> 01:31:52,315
Vader's agreed
to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.

1345
01:31:52,387 --> 01:31:54,321
They'll have to stay here,
but at least they'll be safe.

1346
01:31:54,389 --> 01:31:55,481
Leia:
What about Han?

1347
01:31:55,557 --> 01:31:56,546
Vader's given him
to the bounty hunter.

1348
01:31:56,624 --> 01:31:58,182
Vader wants us
all dead.

1349
01:31:58,259 --> 01:31:59,317
He doesn't want you at all.

1350
01:31:59,394 --> 01:32:01,191
He's after somebody
called Skywalker.

1351
01:32:01,262 --> 01:32:03,196
- Luke.
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.

1352
01:32:03,264 --> 01:32:05,289
And we're the bait!

1353
01:32:05,367 --> 01:32:07,232
He's on his way.

1354
01:32:07,302 --> 01:32:10,396
You fixed us all
real good, didn't you?

1355
01:32:10,472 --> 01:32:11,700
My friend.

1356
01:32:13,975 --> 01:32:15,135
Stop!

1357
01:32:17,145 --> 01:32:18,703
I've done all I can.

1358
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:20,213
I'm sorry
I couldn't do better...

1359
01:32:20,281 --> 01:32:21,908
but I've got
my own problems.

1360
01:32:21,983 --> 01:32:23,382
Yeah.

1361
01:32:23,451 --> 01:32:25,316
You're a real hero.

1362
01:32:35,663 --> 01:32:38,257
You certainly have
a way with people.

1363
01:32:42,003 --> 01:32:43,630
Ah... Ah...

1364
01:32:52,614 --> 01:32:54,775
This facility is crude...

1365
01:32:54,849 --> 01:32:57,818
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker...

1366
01:32:57,886 --> 01:33:00,320
for his journey to the emperor.

1367
01:33:00,388 --> 01:33:03,255
Lord Vader, ship approaching,
X-wing class.

1368
01:33:03,324 --> 01:33:05,656
Good.
Monitor Skywalker...

1369
01:33:05,727 --> 01:33:07,752
and allow him
to land.

1370
01:33:07,829 --> 01:33:11,230
Lord Vader, we only use this facility
for carbon freezing.

1371
01:33:11,299 --> 01:33:13,665
You put him in there,
it might kill him.

1372
01:33:13,735 --> 01:33:15,168
I do not want...

1373
01:33:15,236 --> 01:33:16,669
the emperor's prize
damaged.

1374
01:33:16,738 --> 01:33:19,229
We will test it
on Captain Solo.

1375
01:33:41,796 --> 01:33:44,629
If only you'd
attached my legs...

1376
01:33:44,699 --> 01:33:46,667
I wouldn't be
in this ridiculous position.

1377
01:33:46,734 --> 01:33:48,167
Now remember,
Chewbacca...

1378
01:33:48,236 --> 01:33:50,170
you have a responsibility for me...

1379
01:33:50,238 --> 01:33:52,103
so don't do anything foolish.

1380
01:34:04,853 --> 01:34:06,650
What's going on...

1381
01:34:06,721 --> 01:34:08,245
buddy?

1382
01:34:08,323 --> 01:34:11,292
You're being put
into carbon freeze.

1383
01:34:11,359 --> 01:34:14,851
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

1384
01:34:14,929 --> 01:34:16,362
The Empire
will compensate you...

1385
01:34:16,431 --> 01:34:17,523
if he dies.

1386
01:34:17,599 --> 01:34:19,533
Put him in.

1387
01:34:19,601 --> 01:34:20,693
Rrrah!

1388
01:34:20,768 --> 01:34:23,202

stop, stop!

1390
01:34:25,273 --> 01:34:28,800
I'm not ready to die!

1391
01:34:28,877 --> 01:34:31,368
Hey! Hey! Listen
to me, Chewie.

1392
01:34:31,446 --> 01:34:33,505
This won't help me.

1393
01:34:33,581 --> 01:34:34,843
Hey, save your strength.

1394
01:34:34,916 --> 01:34:37,544
There will be
another time.

1395
01:34:37,619 --> 01:34:39,712
The princess...

1396
01:34:39,787 --> 01:34:41,618
You have to
take care of her.

1397
01:34:43,791 --> 01:34:46,123
Do you hear me?
Huh?

1398
01:34:46,194 --> 01:34:47,491
Gahhh...

1399
01:34:59,707 --> 01:35:00,901
I love you.

1400
01:35:00,975 --> 01:35:02,704

1401
01:35:23,731 --> 01:35:25,198
Gahhh!

1402
01:35:31,839 --> 01:35:34,000
What's going on?
Turn around!

1403
01:35:34,075 --> 01:35:35,508
Chewbacca,
I can't see.

1404
01:35:49,691 --> 01:35:51,921
Gahhh.

1405
01:36:33,234 --> 01:36:36,670
Oh, they've encased him
in carbonite.

1406
01:36:36,738 --> 01:36:38,433
He should be quite
well-protected...

1407
01:36:38,506 --> 01:36:40,474
if he survived the freezing process,
that is.

1408
01:36:40,541 --> 01:36:43,442
Well, Calrissian,
did he survive?

1409
01:36:43,511 --> 01:36:45,376
Yes, he's alive.

1410
01:36:45,446 --> 01:36:47,607
And in perfect hibernation.

1411
01:36:47,682 --> 01:36:50,674
He's all yours,
bounty hunter.

1412
01:36:50,752 --> 01:36:53,277
Reset the chamber
for Skywalker.

1413
01:36:55,657 --> 01:36:57,522
Skywalker has
just landed, lord.

1414
01:36:57,592 --> 01:37:01,528
Good. See to it
that he finds his way in here.

1415
01:37:05,733 --> 01:37:10,193
Calrissian, take the princess
and the Wookiee to my ship.

1416
01:37:10,271 --> 01:37:12,466
You said they'd be left in the city
under my supervision.

1417
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:14,633
I am altering the deal.

1418
01:37:14,709 --> 01:37:17,473

alter it any further.

We're getting
out of here.

1433
01:41:10,978 --> 01:41:12,775
I knew all along.
It had to be a mistake.

1434
01:41:12,847 --> 01:41:15,748
Do you think that after what you did
to Han, we're going to trust you?

1435
01:41:15,816 --> 01:41:16,612
Grrr!

1436
01:41:16,684 --> 01:41:18,379
I had no choice.

1437
01:41:18,452 --> 01:41:20,044
What are you doing?
Trust him! Trust him!

1438
01:41:20,121 --> 01:41:23,181
We understand, don't we,
Chewie? He had no choice.

1439
01:41:23,257 --> 01:41:24,849
I'm just
trying to help.

1440
01:41:24,926 --> 01:41:27,258
We don't need
any of your help.

1441
01:41:27,328 --> 01:41:28,727
Haaa...

1442
01:41:28,796 --> 01:41:29,592
Grrr!

1443
01:41:29,664 --> 01:41:31,928
Ha... Ha...

1444
01:41:31,999 --> 01:41:33,057
What?

1445
01:41:33,134 --> 01:41:34,226
Han...

1446
01:41:34,302 --> 01:41:35,462
It sounds like Han.

1447
01:41:35,536 --> 01:41:37,094
There's still
a chance...

1448
01:41:37,171 --> 01:41:38,934
to save Han...

1449
01:41:39,006 --> 01:41:41,372
at the east...

1450
01:41:41,442 --> 01:41:43,137
platform.

1451
01:41:43,210 --> 01:41:44,234
Chewie.

1452
01:41:46,847 --> 01:41:49,475
I'm terribly sorry
about all this.

1453
01:41:49,550 --> 01:41:51,381
After all,
he's only a Wookiee.

1454
01:41:51,452 --> 01:41:55,081
Put Captain Solo
in the cargo hold.

01:42:12,673 --> 01:42:14,470
Wait. Turn around, you woolly...

1458
01:42:14,542 --> 01:42:18,444
Hurry! Hurry! We're trying to save Han
from the bounty hunter.

1459
01:42:19,914 --> 01:42:23,577
Well, at least you're still in one piece.

1460
01:42:23,651 --> 01:42:26,085
Look what's happened to me.

1461
01:42:37,999 --> 01:42:40,627
Oh, no! Chewie,
they're behind you!

1462
01:42:53,547 --> 01:42:55,947
You have learned
much, young one.

1463
01:42:56,017 --> 01:42:58,178
You'll find
I'm full of surprises.

1464
01:43:09,196 --> 01:43:12,859
Your destiny lies
with me, Skywalker.

1465
01:43:12,933 --> 01:43:16,266
Obi-Wan knew this
to be true.

1466
01:43:16,337 --> 01:43:17,167
No.

1467
01:43:21,575 --> 01:43:22,473
Aaah!

1468
01:43:24,245 --> 01:43:25,644
All too easy.

1469
01:43:30,885 --> 01:43:33,353
Perhaps you're
not as strong...

1470
01:43:33,421 --> 01:43:35,321
as the emperor thought.

1471
01:43:36,457 --> 01:43:38,152
Impressive.

1472
01:43:40,061 --> 01:43:41,528
Most impressive.

1473
01:43:44,398 --> 01:43:45,990
Aaah!

1474
01:43:48,969 --> 01:43:50,960
Obi-Wan has
taught you well.

1475
01:43:51,038 --> 01:43:53,438
You have
controlled your fear.

1476
01:43:54,909 --> 01:43:56,399
Now...

1477
01:43:56,477 --> 01:43:59,071
release your anger.

1478
01:43:59,146 --> 01:44:02,240
Only your hatred
can destroy me.

1479
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:14,057
Ohh!

1480
01:46:12,453 --> 01:46:14,717
The security code
has been changed.

1481
01:46:14,788 --> 01:46:16,722
R2, you can tell
the computer...

1482
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:18,121
to override
the security systems.

1483
01:46:18,192 --> 01:46:20,626
R2, hurry!

1484
01:46:21,662 --> 01:46:23,220
Attention. This is
Lando Calrissian.

1485
01:46:23,297 --> 01:46:25,162
The Empire has taken
control of the city.

1486
01:46:25,232 --> 01:46:28,793
I advise everyone to leave
before more imperial troops arrive.

1487
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:34,937
This way.

1488
01:46:35,008 --> 01:46:37,442
Well, don't blame me.
I'm an interpreter.

1489
01:46:37,511 --> 01:46:41,675
I'm not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.

1490
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:01,529
<i>[Beep Blip Beep Beep]</i>

1491

1493
01:47:05,272 --> 01:47:07,035
It's fixed!

1494
01:47:08,842 --> 01:47:11,675
Just open the door,
you stupid lump!

1495
01:47:20,387 --> 01:47:22,912
I never doubted you
for a second.

1496
01:47:22,990 --> 01:47:24,014
Wonderful!

1497
01:47:46,847 --> 01:47:48,940
Ouch! Oh! That hurts!

1498
01:47:49,016 --> 01:47:51,246

1507
01:49:10,430 --> 01:49:11,954

to discover your power.

1523
01:50:01,014 --> 01:50:03,278
Obi-Wan never told you...

1524

what happened
to your father.

1525
01:50:05,352 --> 01:50:07,081
He told me enough.

1526
01:50:09,656 --> 01:50:11,556
He told me
you killed him.

1527
01:50:11,625 --> 01:50:12,956
No.

1528
01:50:13,026 --> 01:50:15,426

01:57:35,201 --> 01:57:36,634
Chewbacca can do it.

1613
01:57:36,703 --> 01:57:38,136
I'm standing here
in pieces...

1614
01:57:38,204 --> 01:57:41,435
and you're having
delusions of grandeur!

1615
01:57:43,877 --> 01:57:46,038
You did it!

1616
01:58:42,902 --> 01:58:45,496
Luke, we're ready
for takeoff.

1617
01:58:45,572 --> 01:58:46,766
<i>Good luck, Lando.</i>

1618
01:58:46,839 --> 01:58:49,000
<i>When we find</i>
<i>Jabba the Hutt...</i>

1619
01:58:49,075 --> 01:58:50,508
<i>and that</i>
<i>bounty hunter...</i>

1620
01:58:50,577 --> 01:58:51,771
<i>we'll contact you.</i>

1621
01:58:51,844 --> 01:58:54,540
I'll meet you
at the rendezvous point on Tatooine.

1622
01:58:54,614 --> 01:58:56,741
Princess,
we'll find Han.

1623
01:58:56,816 --> 01:58:58,078
I promise.

1624
01:58:58,151 --> 01:59:00,415
Chewie, I'll be waiting
for your signal.

1625
01:59:00,486 --> 01:59:02,249
Take care, you two.

1626
01:59:02,322 --> 01:59:04,222
<i>May the Force</i>
<i>be with you.</i>

1627
01:59:04,290 --> 01:59:05,848
Gahhh.

1628
01:59:05,925 --> 01:59:08,416
<i>Gahhh.</i>

1629
01:59:17,503 --> 01:59:18,492
Ow.

1630
01:59:40,693 --> 01:59:43,594
<i>[Beep Blip Blip Beep]</i>

1631
02:00:02,148 --> 02:00:04,139
<i>[Beep Blip]</i>
