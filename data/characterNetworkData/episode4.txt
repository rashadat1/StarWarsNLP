Yeah?

187
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,481
This R2 unit has
a bad motivator. Look.

Excuse me, sir...

191

but that R2 unit is in prime condition,
a real bargain.

192
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,929
Uncle Owen, what about that one?

193
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,398
What about that blue one?

194
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,833
We'll take that one.

195
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,097
Take this away.

196
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,661
You'll be very pleased
with that one, sir.

197
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,604
He really is in first-class condition.

198
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:03,902
I've worked with him before.

I'm only a droid...

about such things...

As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

Well, if there's
a bright center to the universe...

You can call me Luke.

Have you been in many battles?

241
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,161
Several, I think.

242
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,789
Actually, there's not much to tell.

243

than an interpreter...

What is that?

I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,843
A person of some importance, I believe.

00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,322
a resident of these parts...

273
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,266
and it's a private message for him.

274
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,327
Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what
he's talking about.

275
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,396
Our last master
was Captain Antilles.

276

But with all
we've been through...

277
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:53,169
this little R2 unit has
become a bit eccentric.

278
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:56,408
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

279
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,177
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know
what he's talking about?

280
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,185
I don't know any Obi-Wan...

281
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:04,689
but old Ben lives out
beyond the Dune Sea.

282
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,553
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

has short-circuited
his recording system.

290
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,638
He suggests that if you remove the bolt...

291
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,074
he might be able to play
back the entire recording.

Oh, yeah. Well...

Bring her back.
Play back the entire message.

I'm sorry, sir...

305
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,671
but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,436
Here. See what you can do with him.

307
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,170

You know, I think that R2 unit

00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:23,293
What makes you think that?

316
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,836
Well, I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

317
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,873
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

318
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,243
I thought he might have meant old Ben.

319
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,801
Do you know what
he's talking about?

320
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,778
Mm-mm.

321
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:39,112
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

That wizard's just a crazy old man.

323
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:44,488
Tomorrow, I want you to take
that R2 unit to Anchorhead...

324
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,080
and have its memory erased.

325
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,149
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

326
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:52,625
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

327
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:53,686
He won't.

328
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,233
I don't think he exists anymore.

329
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,701
He died about the same time
as your father.

330
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,067
He knew my father?

331
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,867
I told you to forget it.

332
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,434
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

333
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,479
In the morning, I want them
up there on the south ridge...

00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,447
working on those condensers.

335
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,573
Yes, sir.

336
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:15,614
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

337
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:19,453
In fact, I, uh, was also thinking
about our agreement...

338
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:22,755
about me staying on another season?

339
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,058
And if these new droids
do work out...

340
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,098
I want to transmit my application
to the academy this year.

341
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:29,998
You mean the next semester
before the harvest?

342
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,899
Sure. There's more
than enough droids.

343
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,029
Harvest is when I need you the most.

344
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,164
It's only one season more.

345
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,868
This year we'll make
enough on the harvest...

346
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,604
that I'll be able
to hire more hands...

347
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:42,613
and then you can go
to the academy next year.

348
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,478
You must understand
I need you here, Luke.

349
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,380
But it's a whole 'nother year!

350
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:47,748
Look, it's only one more season.

351
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,117
Yeah, that's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

352
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:51,120
Where are you going?

353
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:52,383
Looks like I'm going nowhere.

354
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:54,391
I have to go finish
cleaning those droids.

355
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,450
Owen, he can't stay here forever.

356
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:57,859
Most of his friends have gone.

357
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,056
It means so much to him.

358
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,962
I'll make it up to him next year.

359
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,057
I promise.

360
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:06,570
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.

361
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,697
He has too much of his father in him.

362
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,866
That's what I'm afraid of.

363
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,087
Ooh!

364
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:01,489
What are you doing
hiding back there?

365
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,018
It wasn't my fault, sir.
Please don't deactivate me.

366
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,963
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

367
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,625
Kept babbling on about his mission.

368
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,362
Oh, no.

369
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:22,136
That R2 unit has always
been a problem.

370
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,773
These astrodroids
are getting quite out of hand.

371
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,840
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.

372
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,442
How could I be so stupid?

373
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,851
He's nowhere in sight.

374
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,013
Blast it!

375
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,717
Pardon me, sir,
but couldn't we go after him?

376
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,555
It's too dangerous
with all the Sand People around.

377
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,652
We'll have to wait until morning.

378
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:38,957
Uncle Owen:
Luke! I'm shutting the power down.

379
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,521
All right!
I'll be there in a few minutes.

380
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,124
Boy, am I gonna get it.

381
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:46,102
That little droid's going to
cause me a lotta trouble.

382
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,571
Oh, he excels at that, sir.

383
00:26:58,516 --> 00:26:59,744
Luke?

384
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,180
Luke!

385
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,021
Luke!

386
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:13,027
Have you seen Luke this morning?

387
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,259
He said he had some things to do
before he started today...

388
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,527
so he left early.

389
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,125
Did he take those
two new droids with him?

390
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,636
I think so.

391
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:22,434
Well, he better have those units
in the south range...

392
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,941
repaired by midday,
or there'll be hell to pay.

393
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,111
Lookit, there's a droid on the scanner.

394
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:28,543
Dead ahead.

395
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:31,741
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator!

00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:40,056

397
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:55,770

399
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,976
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.

00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:02,070
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

You're fortunate he doesn't blast you...

404
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:07,851
into a million pieces right here!

405
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,046
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.

00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,057
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

409
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:19,995
Sand People, or worse.

00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:22,033
Come on.
Let's go have a look.

411

Come on!

412
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,603
Well, there are
two Banthas down there...

413
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,664
but I don't see any...
Wait a second.

414
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,209
They're Sand People, all right.

415
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,973
I can see one of them now.

You've had a busy day.

You're fortunate
to be all in one piece.

00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:18,605
Ben Kenobi?

428
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,708
Boy, am I glad to see you.

429
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:23,845

to be traveled lightly.

432
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:31,094
what brings you out this far?

433
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,891
This little droid.

434
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,864
<i>[Blip Blip]</i>

435
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,525
I think he's searching
for his former master...

436
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:40,037
but I've never seen such devotion
in a droid before.

437
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,072
He claims to be the property...

438
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,767
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

439
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,070
Is he a relative of yours?

440
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,577
Do you know who
he's talking about?

441
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,772
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

442
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,579
Obi-Wan.

443
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:58,645
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.

444
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,157
A long time.

445
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,592
I think my uncle knows him.

446
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,219
He said he was dead.

447
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,127
Oh, he's not dead.

448
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,392
Not yet.

449
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,933
You know him?

450
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,936
Well, of course I know him.
He's me.

<i>[Beep Beep]</i>

452

I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan...

453
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,445
since, oh, before you were born.

454
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,343
Well, then the droid
does belong to you.

455
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:26,110
I don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

456
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,216
Very interesting.

00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:33,589
I think we better get indoors.

The Sand People are easily startled...

460

Can you stand?

465
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:00,748
We've got to get out of here before
the Sand People return.

466
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:03,343
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

467
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,151
There's no sense in you risking yourself
on my account.

468
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,657
I'm done for.

469
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:09,522
Luke: No, you're not.

470
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,686
What kind of talk is that?

471
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,457
Quickly. They're on the move.

472
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:19,328
No, my father didn't
fight in the wars.

473
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:21,201
He was a navigator
on a spice freighter.

474
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,172
That's what your uncle told you.

475
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,106
He didn't hold
with your father's ideals.

476
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:26,404
Thought he should
have stayed here...

477
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,342
and not gotten involved.

478
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,381
You fought in the Clone Wars?

479
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,417
Yes. I was once a Jedi knight...

480
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:34,781
the same as your father.

481
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,152
I wish I'd known him.

482
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:43,091
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy...

483
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,753
and a cunning warrior.

484
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:45,761
I understand you've become...

485
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,594
quite a good pilot yourself.

486
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,635
And he was a good friend.

487
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,864
Which reminds me...

488
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,702
I have something here for you.

489
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:01,710
Your father wanted you to have this...

490
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,212
when you were old enough...

491
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:05,374
but your uncle
wouldn't allow it.

492
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,042
He feared you might
follow old Obi-Wan...

493
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:09,143
on some damn-fool
idealistic crusade...

494
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,017
like your father did.

495
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,920
Sir, if you'll not be needing me...

496
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,015
I'll close down for a while.

497
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:15,719
Sure. Go ahead.

498
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,028
What is it?

499
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,895
It's your father's lightsaber.

500
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:25,265
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

501
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:29,272
Not as clumsy or random
as a blaster.

502
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:35,245
An elegant weapon
for a more civilized age.

503
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,577
For over a thousand generations...

504
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,582
the Jedi knights were the guardians...

505
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,744
of peace and justice
in the old Republic...

506
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,687
before the dark times...

507
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,384
before the Empire.

508
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:52,294
How did my father die?

509
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:56,725
A young Jedi named Darth Vader...

510
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:59,964
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil...

511
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:04,099
helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.

512
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:08,305
He betrayed and
murdered your father.

513
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:12,338
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

514
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:17,354
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

515
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:18,980
The Force?

516
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:22,493
The Force is what gives
a Jedi his power.

517
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,656
It's an energy field created
by all living things.

518
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,631
It surrounds us, penetrates us...

519
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,792
it binds the galaxy together.

what you are, my little friend...

522
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,414
and where you come from.

523
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,176

524
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,114
I seem to have found it.

525
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:51,451
General Kenobi, years ago
you served my father in the Clone Wars.

526
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,046
Now he begs you to help him...

527
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,092
in his struggle against the Empire.

528
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,219
I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request to you in person.

529
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:00,093
But my ship has fallen under attack...

530
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,530
and I am afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.

531
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,397
I have placed information...

532
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,130
vital to the survival
of the rebellion...

533
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:08,069
into the memory systems
of this R2 unit.

534
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,004
My father will know
how to retrieve it.

535
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,769
You must see this droid...

536
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,437
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.

537
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,241
This is our most desperate hour.

538
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:20,375
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

539
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,127
You must learn
the ways of the Force...

540
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:39,431
if you're to come
with me to Alderaan.

541
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,995
Alderaan?
I'm not going to Alderaan.

542
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,563
I've got to get home.

543
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,040
It's late.
I'm in for it as it is.

544
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:47,907
I need your help, Luke.
<i>She</i> needs your help.

545
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:51,107
I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.

546
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,585
I can't get involved.

547
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,088
I've got work to do.

548
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,751
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it...

549
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,125
but there's nothing
I can do about it right now.

550
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,357
It's all such a long way from here.

551
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,422
That's your uncle talking.

552
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,762
My uncle.

553
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,395
How am I ever gonna explain this?

554
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,200
Learn about the Force, Luke.

555
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,511
Look, I can take you
as far as Anchorhead.

556
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:28,609
You can get a transport there to
Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

557
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:32,713
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

558
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,525
Until this battle station
is fully operational...

559
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,067
we are vulnerable.

560
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,228
The Rebel Alliance
is too well equipped.

561
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,295
They're more dangerous
than you realize.

562
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,840
Dangerous to
your starfleet, Commander...

563
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:53,103
not to this battle station.

564
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:56,169
The rebellion will
continue to gain support...

565
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:57,737
in the Imperial Senate...

566
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:01,148
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

567
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,652
I have just received word...

568
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,314
that the emperor has
dissolved the council permanently.

569
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,983
The last remnants
of the old Republic...

570
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,651
have been swept away.

571
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,217
That's impossible.

572
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:13,695
How will the emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

573
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:16,733
The regional governors
now have direct control...

574
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,564
over their territories.

575
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:22,697
Fear will keep
the local systems in line...

576
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:24,240
fear of this battle station.

577
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,173
And what of the rebellion?

578
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,212
If the rebels have obtained...

579
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:29,576
a complete technical readout
of this station...

580
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,376
it is possible, however unlikely...

581
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,781
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.

582
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:38,117
The plans you refer to will
soon be back in our hands.

583
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,657
Any attack made by the rebels
against this station...

584
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:41,953
would be a useless gesture...

585
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:44,551
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

586
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:48,292
This station is now the ultimate power
in the universe.

587
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,698
I suggest we use it.

588
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,235
Don't be too proud...

589
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,601
of this technological terror
you've constructed.

590
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:58,108
The ability to destroy
a planet is insignificant...

591
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:00,473
next to the power of the Force.

592
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:04,002
Don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.

593
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:07,073
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion...

594
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:09,642
hasn't helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes...

595
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,745
or given you
clairvoyance enough...

596
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:14,052
to find the rebels'
hidden fortre...

597
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,762
I find your lack
of faith disturbing.

598
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:27,397
Enough of this.
Vader, release him.

599
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,029
As you wish.

600
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,335
This bickering is pointless.

601
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:38,212
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress...

602
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:41,149
by the time this station
is operational.

603
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,584
We will then crush the rebellion...

604
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,121
with one swift stroke.

605
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,921
It looks like the Sand People
did this, all right.

606
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,761
Look. There's gaffi sticks,
Bantha tracks.

607
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,959

609
00:38:58,202 --> 00:38:59,191
They didn't...

610
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,795
but we are meant to think they did.

611
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,806
These tracks are side-by-side.

612
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:06,069
Sand People always ride single file...

613
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,077
to hide their numbers.

614
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,511
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.

615
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:14,073
And these blast points,
too accurate...

616
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:15,379
for Sand People.

617
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:19,082
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

618
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:22,284
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

619
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,094
If they traced the robots here...

620
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,428
they may have learned
who they sold them to...

621
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,560
and that would lead
them back... home!

622

And now, Your Highness...

628
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,154
we will discuss the location...

629
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,520
of your hidden rebel base.

630
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,200
There's nothing you could
have done, Luke...

631
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:45,860
had you been there.

632
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:47,699
You'd have been killed, too...

633
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:51,400
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

634
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:55,206
I want to come
with you to Alderaan.

had these droids?

Three or four seasons.

They're up for sale
if you want them.

We don't need to see

00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:54,134
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

712
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,502
And it's gonna cost you
something extra.

713
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:00,071
10,000, all in advance.

714
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:03,107
10,000?

715
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,980
We could almost
buy our own ship for that!

716
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,314
But who's gonna fly it,
kid, you?

717
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,479
You bet I could.
I'm not such a bad pilot myself.

718
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,989
We don't have
to sit here and listen...

719
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:17,185
We can pay you 2,000 now...

720
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:20,321
plus 15 when
we reach Alderaan.

721
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,262
Seventeen, huh?

722
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:28,261
OK You guys got
yourselves a ship.

723
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:29,635
We'll leave as soon
as you're ready.

724
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:30,832
Docking Bay 94.

725
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,102
Ninety-four.

726
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:36,105
Looks like somebody's
beginning to take an interest...

727
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:38,613
in your handiwork.

728
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,809
All right.
We'll check it out.

729
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:54,125
17,000!

730
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:55,755
Those guys must really
be desperate.

731
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:57,925
This could really save my neck.

732
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,697
Get back to the ship,
get it ready.

733
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,363
You'll have to sell your speeder.

734
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:06,012
That's OK I'm never coming back
to this planet again.

735
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,537
[Speaking Huttese]
Going somewhere, Solo?

736
00:49:08,682 --> 00:49:10,479
[Speaking English]
Yes, Greedo.

737
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:11,710
As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

738
00:49:11,785 --> 00:49:13,878
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

739
00:49:13,954 --> 00:49:16,047
[Speaking Huttese]
It's too late.

740
00:49:16,122 --> 00:49:18,556
You should have paid him
when you had the chance.

741
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:22,061
Jabba's put a price on your head
so large...

742
00:49:22,128 --> 00:49:25,120
every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you.

743
00:49:25,198 --> 00:49:27,223
I'm lucky I found you first.

744
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,495
[English]
Yeah, but this time I've got the money.

745
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:33,164
[Huttese] If you give it to me,
I might forget I found you.

746
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:35,833
[English]
I don't have it with me.

747
00:49:35,909 --> 00:49:36,933
Tell Jabba...

748
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:39,171
[Huttese]
Jabba's through with you.

749
00:49:39,245 --> 00:49:41,805
He has no time for smugglers...

750
00:49:41,881 --> 00:49:44,475
who drop their shipments at
the first sign of an imperial cruiser.

751
00:49:44,551 --> 00:49:46,246
Han: Even I get boarded sometimes.

752
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,412
Do you think I had a choice?

753
00:49:48,488 --> 00:49:52,618
[Huttese] You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.

754
00:49:52,692 --> 00:49:54,785
Over my dead body.

755
00:49:54,861 --> 00:49:56,158
Greedo: That's the idea.

756
00:49:56,229 --> 00:50:00,256
I've been looking forward to this
for a long time.

757
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:02,028
I'll bet you have.

758
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:16,915
Sorry about the mess.

759
00:50:26,092 --> 00:50:29,687
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

760
00:50:29,763 --> 00:50:32,857
It'll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.

761
00:50:32,932 --> 00:50:34,900
The final checkout is completed.

762
00:50:34,968 --> 00:50:36,526
All systems are operational.

763
00:50:36,603 --> 00:50:38,537
What course shall we set?

764
00:50:38,605 --> 00:50:40,300
Perhaps she would respond...

765
00:50:40,373 --> 00:50:42,307
to an alternative
form of persuasion.

766
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:43,808
What do you mean?

767
00:50:43,877 --> 00:50:45,811
I think it is time
we demonstrated...

768
00:50:45,879 --> 00:50:47,642
the full power of this station.

769
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:49,272
Set your course for Alderaan.

770
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:50,782
With pleasure.

771
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:53,182
Lock the door, R2.

772
00:50:54,387 --> 00:50:57,720
Check this side of the street.

773
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:04,224
The door's locked.
Move on to the next.

774
00:51:09,369 --> 00:51:12,236
I would much rather have
gone with Master Luke...

775
00:51:12,305 --> 00:51:13,829
than stay here with you.

776
00:51:13,907 --> 00:51:16,273
I don't know what
all this trouble is about...

777
00:51:16,342 --> 00:51:18,037
but I'm sure
it must be your fault.

778
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:19,043
<i>[Beep Beep]</i>

779
00:51:19,112 --> 00:51:20,374
You watch your language.

780
00:51:22,415 --> 00:51:25,680
All right. Give it to me.
I'll take it.

781
00:51:25,752 --> 00:51:27,151
Look at this.

782
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,381
Ever since the XP-38 came out,
they just aren't in demand.

783
00:51:29,456 --> 00:51:30,946
It'll be enough.

784
00:51:48,575 --> 00:51:50,634
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting...

785
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:52,075
we ought to do well.

786
00:52:03,056 --> 00:52:04,717
[Speaking Alien Language]

787
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,334
What a piece of junk!

788
00:52:16,402 --> 00:52:18,632
She'll make.5 past light speed.

789
00:52:18,705 --> 00:52:20,229
She may not look like much...

790
00:52:20,306 --> 00:52:21,967
but she's got it
where it counts, kid.

791
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:24,771
I've made a lot of
special modifications myself.

792
00:52:24,844 --> 00:52:27,369
But we're a little rushed,
so if you'll just get on board...

793
00:52:27,447 --> 00:52:28,937
we'll get outta here.

794
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,748
Hello, sir.

795
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:45,297
Which way?

796
00:52:45,365 --> 00:52:46,798
[Speaking Alien Language]

797
00:52:46,866 --> 00:52:49,232
All right, men,
load your weapons.

798
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:53,364
Stop that ship!
Blast them!

799
00:53:02,682 --> 00:53:04,479
Chewie, get us out of here!

800
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:10,185
Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much
I hate space travel.

801
00:53:21,467 --> 00:53:24,493
[Grrr]

802
00:53:25,572 --> 00:53:27,039
Looks like an imperial cruiser.

803
00:53:27,106 --> 00:53:28,073
Our passengers must be hotter
than I thought.

804
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:29,574
Try and hold 'em off.

805
00:53:29,642 --> 00:53:31,633
Angle the deflector shields
while I make the calculations...

806
00:53:31,711 --> 00:53:32,643
for the jump to light speed.

807
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:44,720
Stay sharp.
There's two more comin' in.

808
00:53:44,791 --> 00:53:46,349
They're gonna try
and cut us off.

809
00:53:46,426 --> 00:53:48,291
Why don't you outrun 'em?
I thought you said this thing was fast!

810
00:53:48,361 --> 00:53:50,420
Watch your mouth, kid, or you're
gonna find yourself floating home.

811
00:53:50,496 --> 00:53:51,895
We'll be safe enough...

812
00:53:51,965 --> 00:53:53,933
once we make the jump
to hyperspace.

813
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,900
Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
We'll lose 'em.

814
00:53:59,973 --> 00:54:02,032
Here's where the fun begins.

815
00:54:02,108 --> 00:54:03,905
How long before you can make
the jump to light speed?

816
00:54:03,977 --> 00:54:06,741
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.

817
00:54:06,813 --> 00:54:08,576
Are you kidding?
At the rate they're gaining?

818
00:54:08,648 --> 00:54:11,845
Traveling through hyperspace
ain't like dustin' crops, boy!

819
00:54:11,918 --> 00:54:13,146
Without precise calculations...

820
00:54:13,219 --> 00:54:14,243
we'd fly right through a star...

821
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,810
or bounce too close
to a supernova...

822
00:54:15,888 --> 00:54:17,981
and that would end your trip
real quick, wouldn't it?

823
00:54:18,057 --> 00:54:18,955
What's that flashing?

824
00:54:19,025 --> 00:54:19,992
We're losing a deflector shield.

825
00:54:20,059 --> 00:54:21,492
Go strap yourselves in.

826
00:54:21,561 --> 00:54:23,461
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.

827
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:46,850
We've entered the Alderaan system.

828
00:54:46,919 --> 00:54:48,181
Governor Tarkin.

829
00:54:48,254 --> 00:54:49,721
I should have expected...

830
00:54:49,789 --> 00:54:51,757
to find you holding Vader's leash.

831
00:54:51,824 --> 00:54:53,416
I recognized your foul stench...

832
00:54:53,493 --> 00:54:55,484
when I was brought on board.

833
00:54:56,596 --> 00:54:58,860
Charming to the last.

834
00:54:58,931 --> 00:55:01,627
You don't know
how hard I found it...

835
00:55:01,701 --> 00:55:03,760
signing the order
to terminate your life.

836
00:55:03,836 --> 00:55:04,928
I'm surprised you had the courage...

837
00:55:05,004 --> 00:55:06,596
to take the responsibility yourself.

838
00:55:06,673 --> 00:55:09,733
Princess Leia,
before your execution...

839
00:55:09,809 --> 00:55:11,436
I would like you to be my guest...

840
00:55:11,511 --> 00:55:15,140
at a ceremony that will make
this battle station operational.

841
00:55:15,214 --> 00:55:18,342
No star system will dare
oppose the emperor now.

842
00:55:18,418 --> 00:55:20,886
The more you tighten
your grip, Tarkin...

843
00:55:20,953 --> 00:55:23,751
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

844
00:55:23,823 --> 00:55:26,815
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

845
00:55:26,893 --> 00:55:29,327
In a way,
you have determined...

846
00:55:29,395 --> 00:55:32,262
the choice of the planet
that will be destroyed first.

847
00:55:32,332 --> 00:55:34,232
Since you are reluctant...

848
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:37,269
to provide us with the location
of the rebel base...

849
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:40,272
I have chosen to test this station's
destructive power...

850
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:43,434
on your home planet of Alderaan.

851
00:55:43,509 --> 00:55:44,567
No! Alderaan is peaceful.

852
00:55:44,644 --> 00:55:45,975
We have no weapons.
You can't possibly...

853
00:55:46,045 --> 00:55:48,411
You would prefer another target?
A military target?

854
00:55:48,481 --> 00:55:50,972
Then name the system.

855
00:55:52,885 --> 00:55:56,286
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

856
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:59,018
Where is the rebel base?

857
00:56:02,562 --> 00:56:04,792
Dantooine.

858
00:56:04,864 --> 00:56:06,331
They're on Dantooine.

859
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:08,833
There. You see, Lord Vader?

860
00:56:08,901 --> 00:56:10,334
She can be reasonable.

861
00:56:10,403 --> 00:56:12,303
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.

862
00:56:12,372 --> 00:56:13,862
What?

863
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,339
You're far too trusting.

864
00:56:15,408 --> 00:56:16,875
Dantooine is too remote...

865
00:56:16,943 --> 00:56:19,537
to make an effective demonstration,
but don't worry.

866
00:56:19,612 --> 00:56:22,547
We will deal with your rebel friends
soon enough.

867
00:56:22,615 --> 00:56:23,707
No!

868
00:56:24,951 --> 00:56:27,044
Commence primary ignition.

869
00:56:50,176 --> 00:56:53,577
Are you all right?
What's wrong?

870
00:56:53,646 --> 00:56:56,080
I felt a great disturbance
in the Force...

871
00:56:56,149 --> 00:56:57,673
as if millions of voices...

872
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,684
suddenly cried out in terror...

873
00:56:59,752 --> 00:57:01,344
and were suddenly silenced.

874
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:04,219
I fear something terrible
has happened.

875
00:57:05,491 --> 00:57:08,324
You'd better get on
with your exercises.

876
00:57:10,363 --> 00:57:13,127
Well, you can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.

877
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:15,190
I told you I'd outrun them.

878
00:57:19,205 --> 00:57:21,298
Don't everybody thank me at once.

879
00:57:21,374 --> 00:57:25,868
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.

880
00:57:33,352 --> 00:57:35,183
Now be careful, R2.

881
00:57:43,196 --> 00:57:44,788
Argh!

882
00:57:44,864 --> 00:57:46,661
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.

883
00:57:46,732 --> 00:57:49,599
Let him have it. It's not wise
to upset a Wookiee.

884
00:57:49,669 --> 00:57:52,069
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

885
00:57:52,138 --> 00:57:55,198
That's 'cause a droid don't pull
people's arms out of their sockets...

886
00:57:55,274 --> 00:57:56,741
when they lose.

887
00:57:56,809 --> 00:57:58,868
Wookiees are known to do that.

888
00:57:58,945 --> 00:58:00,640
Grrr...

889
00:58:00,713 --> 00:58:03,204
I see your point, sir.

890
00:58:03,282 --> 00:58:04,749
I suggest a new strategy, R2.

891
00:58:04,817 --> 00:58:06,307
Let the Wookiee win.

892
00:58:06,385 --> 00:58:08,945
Argh!

893
00:58:24,203 --> 00:58:28,435
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

894
00:58:28,508 --> 00:58:30,533
You mean it controls your actions?

895
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:33,511
Partially, but it also
obeys your commands.

896
00:58:36,382 --> 00:58:37,974
[Han Solo Laughs]

897
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:41,144
Hokey religions and
ancient weapons are no match...

898
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,949
for a good blaster
at your side, kid.

899
00:58:43,022 --> 00:58:45,354
You don't believe
in the Force, do you?

900
00:58:45,424 --> 00:58:48,723
Kid, I've flown from
one side of this galaxy to the other.

901
00:58:48,794 --> 00:58:50,386
I've seen a lot of strange stuff...

902
00:58:50,463 --> 00:58:52,829
but I've never seen anything
to make me believe...

903
00:58:52,899 --> 00:58:56,391
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything.

904
00:58:56,469 --> 00:59:00,633
Han: There's no mystical
energy field controls my destiny.

905
00:59:00,706 --> 00:59:04,699
It's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.

906
00:59:04,777 --> 00:59:07,712
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

907
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:10,715
This time, let go
your conscious self...

908
00:59:12,652 --> 00:59:14,813
and act on instinct.

909
00:59:14,887 --> 00:59:18,254
With the blast shield down,
I can't even see.

910
00:59:18,324 --> 00:59:19,757
How am I supposed to fight?

911
00:59:19,825 --> 00:59:20,849
Your eyes can deceive you.

912
00:59:20,927 --> 00:59:22,019
Don't trust them.

913
00:59:31,437 --> 00:59:33,769
Stretch out with your feelings.

914
00:59:48,187 --> 00:59:50,382
You see? You can do it.

915
00:59:50,456 --> 00:59:52,117
Han: I call it luck.

916
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:54,853
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.

917
00:59:54,927 --> 00:59:57,327
Look, good against remotes
is one thing.

918
00:59:57,396 --> 01:00:00,331
Good against the living,
that's something else.

919
01:00:00,399 --> 01:00:01,661
[Beeping]

920
01:00:01,734 --> 01:00:03,361
Looks like we're coming
up on Alderaan.

921
01:00:06,706 --> 01:00:08,071
You know, I did feel something.

922
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:09,334
I could almost see the remote.

923
01:00:09,408 --> 01:00:10,340
That's good.

924
01:00:10,409 --> 01:00:12,343
You've taken your first step...

925
01:00:12,411 --> 01:00:14,242
into a larger world.

926
01:00:18,684 --> 01:00:19,776
Yes?

927
01:00:19,852 --> 01:00:22,787
Our scout ships have
reached Dantooine.

928
01:00:22,855 --> 01:00:24,789
They found the remains
of a rebel base...

929
01:00:24,857 --> 01:00:27,257
but they estimate that it has
been deserted for some time.

930
01:00:27,326 --> 01:00:30,887
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

931
01:00:30,963 --> 01:00:33,989
She lied. She lied to us!

932
01:00:34,066 --> 01:00:36,830
I told you she would never...

933
01:00:36,902 --> 01:00:39,336
consciously betray the rebellion.

934
01:00:39,405 --> 01:00:41,807
Terminate her immediately.

935
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:45,770
Stand by, Chewie.
Here we go.

936
01:00:45,844 --> 01:00:47,311
Cut in the sublight engines.

937
01:00:49,515 --> 01:00:51,142
What the...

938
01:00:52,184 --> 01:00:54,175
Arrghh arrgh!

939
01:00:54,253 --> 01:00:56,687
We've come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower.

940
01:00:56,755 --> 01:00:57,983
Some kind of asteroid collision.

941
01:00:58,057 --> 01:00:59,251
It's not on any of the charts.

942
01:00:59,324 --> 01:01:00,382
What's going on?

943
01:01:00,459 --> 01:01:02,825
Our position's correct,
except no Alderaan.

944
01:01:02,895 --> 01:01:04,192
What do you mean?
Where is it?

945
01:01:04,263 --> 01:01:05,457
That's what I'm trying
to tell you, kid.

946
01:01:05,531 --> 01:01:07,055
It ain't there. It's
been totally blown away.

947
01:01:07,132 --> 01:01:08,099
What? How?

948
01:01:08,167 --> 01:01:09,862
Destroyed by the Empire.

949
01:01:09,935 --> 01:01:12,267
The entire starfleet couldn't destroy
the whole planet.

950
01:01:12,337 --> 01:01:13,998
It would take 1,000 ships
with more firepower than...

951
01:01:14,073 --> 01:01:15,597
[Beep]

952
01:01:15,674 --> 01:01:17,505
There's another ship coming in.

953
01:01:17,576 --> 01:01:18,600
Maybe they know what happened.

954
01:01:18,677 --> 01:01:20,008
It's an imperial fighter.

955
01:01:21,547 --> 01:01:22,673
It followed us!

956
01:01:22,748 --> 01:01:24,807
No. It's a short-range fighter.

957
01:01:24,883 --> 01:01:26,908
There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

958
01:01:30,155 --> 01:01:31,952
It sure is leaving in a big hurry.

959
01:01:32,024 --> 01:01:32,956
If they identify us,
we're in big trouble.

960
01:01:33,025 --> 01:01:33,957
Not if I can help it.

961
01:01:34,026 --> 01:01:35,118
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

962
01:01:35,194 --> 01:01:36,252
It would be as well to let it go.

963
01:01:36,328 --> 01:01:37,260
It's too far out of range.

964
01:01:37,329 --> 01:01:38,591
Not for long.

965
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:45,698
A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.

966
01:01:45,771 --> 01:01:48,433
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

967
01:01:48,507 --> 01:01:50,168
Well, he ain't gonna
be around long enough...

968
01:01:50,242 --> 01:01:51,402
to tell anybody about us.

969
01:01:53,879 --> 01:01:55,471
Luke: Look at him.
He's heading for that small moon.

970
01:01:55,547 --> 01:01:58,448
Han: I think I can get him before
he gets there. He's almost in range.

971
01:02:00,018 --> 01:02:02,077
That's no moon.

972
01:02:02,154 --> 01:02:03,644
It's a space station.

973
01:02:03,722 --> 01:02:05,553
It's too big to be a space station.

974
01:02:08,861 --> 01:02:11,329
I have a very bad feeling about this.

975
01:02:11,396 --> 01:02:13,193
Turn the ship around.

976
01:02:13,265 --> 01:02:15,495
Yeah. I think you're right.
Full reverse!

977
01:02:15,567 --> 01:02:17,762
Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power.

978
01:02:22,007 --> 01:02:24,475
Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power!

979
01:02:26,845 --> 01:02:28,608
Luke: Why are we still
moving towards it?!

980
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,511
We're caught in a tractor beam.
It's pulling us in!

981
01:02:30,582 --> 01:02:32,277
There's got to be
something you can do!

982
01:02:32,351 --> 01:02:33,477
There's nothing
I can do about it, kid.

983
01:02:33,552 --> 01:02:34,985
I'm at full power.
I'm gonna have to shut down.

984
01:02:35,053 --> 01:02:36,680
They're not gonna
get me without a fight.

985
01:02:41,226 --> 01:02:42,557
You can't win...

986
01:02:42,628 --> 01:02:44,789
but there are alternatives
to fighting.

987
01:03:01,413 --> 01:03:03,574
Clear Bay 327.

988
01:03:03,649 --> 01:03:06,049
We are opening
the magnetic field.

989
01:03:20,632 --> 01:03:21,894
To your stations!

990
01:03:21,967 --> 01:03:23,298
Come with me.

991
01:03:27,206 --> 01:03:28,764
<i>Close all outboard shields.</i>

992
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,831
<i>Close all outboard shields.</i>

993
01:03:32,277 --> 01:03:33,301
- [Beep]
- Yes?

994
01:03:33,378 --> 01:03:34,709
<i>We've captured a freighter...</i>

995
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:36,304
<i>entering the remains</i>
<i>of the Alderaan system.</i>

996
01:03:36,381 --> 01:03:38,178
<i>Its markings match</i>
<i>those of a ship...</i>

997
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:40,718
<i>that blasted its way</i>
<i>out of Mos Eisley.</i>

998
01:03:40,786 --> 01:03:44,347
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

999
01:03:44,423 --> 01:03:47,392
She may yet be of some use to us.

1000
01:03:52,064 --> 01:03:56,057
<i>Unlock 1, 5, 7, and 9.</i>
<i>Release charge.</i>

1001
01:03:57,903 --> 01:04:00,030
<i>316, report to control.</i>

1002
01:04:02,975 --> 01:04:05,000
There's no one on board, sir.

1003
01:04:05,077 --> 01:04:07,841
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after takeoff.

1004
01:04:07,913 --> 01:04:09,813
It must be a decoy, sir.

1005
01:04:09,881 --> 01:04:11,473
Several of the escape pods
have been jettisoned.

1006
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:12,482
Did you find any droids?

1007
01:04:12,551 --> 01:04:13,518
No, sir.

1008
01:04:13,585 --> 01:04:15,450
If there were any on board,
they must also have jettisoned.

1009
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,078
Send a scanning crew aboard.

1010
01:04:17,155 --> 01:04:18,986
I want every part
of this ship checked.

1011
01:04:19,057 --> 01:04:20,081
Yes, sir.

1012
01:04:20,158 --> 01:04:21,591
I sense something...

1013
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:24,652
a presence I've not felt since...

1014
01:04:27,299 --> 01:04:28,891
Get me a scanning crew in here
on the double.

1015
01:04:28,967 --> 01:04:30,696
I want every part
of this ship checked.

1016
01:04:50,455 --> 01:04:52,423
Boy, it's lucky you had
these compartments.

1017
01:04:52,491 --> 01:04:53,788
I use them for smuggling.

1018
01:04:53,859 --> 01:04:55,690
I never thought I'd
be smuggling myself in 'em.

1019
01:04:55,761 --> 01:04:57,160
This is ridiculous.

1020
01:04:57,229 --> 01:04:58,526
Even if I could take off...

1021
01:04:58,597 --> 01:05:00,121
I'd never get past
the tractor beam.

1022
01:05:00,198 --> 01:05:01,495
Leave that to me.

1023
01:05:01,566 --> 01:05:04,467
Damn fool, I knew
that you were gonna say that.

1024
01:05:04,536 --> 01:05:05,867
Who's the more foolish...

1025
01:05:05,937 --> 01:05:07,996
the fool or the fool
who follows him?

1026
01:05:08,073 --> 01:05:09,563
Argh!

1027
01:05:16,748 --> 01:05:18,181
The ship's all yours.

1028
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:20,184
If the scanners pick up anything...

1029
01:05:20,252 --> 01:05:22,186
report it immediately.

1030
01:05:22,254 --> 01:05:24,085
All right, let's go.

1031
01:05:36,935 --> 01:05:38,926
[Thud]

1032
01:05:39,004 --> 01:05:40,437
Han: Hey, down there!

1033
01:05:42,441 --> 01:05:44,534
Could you give us a hand
with this?

1034
01:05:49,381 --> 01:05:51,542
[Zap Zap]

1035
01:05:53,018 --> 01:05:56,044
TK-421, why aren't you
at your post?

1036
01:05:56,121 --> 01:05:58,453
TK-421, do you copy?

1037
01:06:10,702 --> 01:06:12,567
Take over.
We've got a bad transmitter.

1038
01:06:12,637 --> 01:06:14,502
I'll see what I can do.

1039
01:06:17,209 --> 01:06:19,074
Grrr!

1040
01:06:30,822 --> 01:06:33,882
Between his howling and your blasting
everything in sight...

1041
01:06:33,959 --> 01:06:36,655
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

1042
01:06:36,728 --> 01:06:37,956
Bring them on!

1043
01:06:38,029 --> 01:06:39,394
I'd prefer a straight fight
to all this sneakin' around.

1044
01:06:39,464 --> 01:06:41,523
We've found the computer outlet, sir.

1045
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,398
Plug in. He should be able to interpret
the entire imperial network.

1046
01:06:44,469 --> 01:06:46,198
<i>[Beep Blip]</i>

1047
01:06:49,741 --> 01:06:52,209
<i>[Blip Bleep Whistle]</i>

1048
01:06:54,579 --> 01:06:57,275
He says he's found
the main controls...

1049
01:06:57,349 --> 01:06:59,783
to the power beam that's
holding the ship here.

1050
01:06:59,851 --> 01:07:02,046
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

1051
01:07:10,762 --> 01:07:13,629
I don't think you boys can help.

1052
01:07:13,698 --> 01:07:15,461
I must go alone.

1053
01:07:15,534 --> 01:07:17,001
Whatever you say.

1054
01:07:17,068 --> 01:07:19,036
I've done more than I bargained for
on this trip already.

1055
01:07:19,104 --> 01:07:20,401
I want to go with you.

1056
01:07:20,472 --> 01:07:23,100
Be patient, Luke.
Stay and watch over the droids.

1057
01:07:23,175 --> 01:07:24,665
They must be delivered safely...

1058
01:07:24,743 --> 01:07:27,803
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

Where did you dig up
that old fossil?

Ben is a great man.

1065

Yeah, great at getting us
into trouble.

He says "I've found her"

The old man wants us
to wait right here.

But he didn't know
she was here.

1094

Just find a way back into that
detention block.

I'm not going anywhere.

1096

They're going to execute her.

1097

Look, a few minutes ago, you said...

1098
01:08:53,061 --> 01:08:54,119
you didn't want to just wait here
to be captured.

1099
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:55,163
Now all you want to do is stay?

Marching into the detention area...

01:08:59,501 --> 01:09:01,162
Better her than me.

1104
01:09:08,977 --> 01:09:10,308
She's rich.

01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:14,143
Rich?

01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:15,808
Mm-hmm. Rich, powerful.

1108
01:09:15,884 --> 01:09:18,978
Listen, if you were to rescue her,
the reward would be...

You better be right about this.

Master Luke, sir,
pardon me for asking...

1127
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:55,221
but what should R2 and I do
if we're discovered here?

01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:56,780
Lock the door.

01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:00,957

I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.

1414
01:27:47,561 --> 01:27:49,119
We meet again at last.

1415
01:27:49,196 --> 01:27:52,324
The circle is now complete.

1416
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,925
When I left you,
I was but the learner.

1417
01:27:55,002 --> 01:27:57,095
Now <i>I</i> am the master.

1418
01:27:57,171 --> 01:28:00,106
Only a master of evil, Darth.

1419
01:28:19,493 --> 01:28:21,791
Your powers are weak, old man.

1420
01:28:21,862 --> 01:28:23,489
You can't win, Darth.

1421
01:28:23,564 --> 01:28:25,532
If you strike me down...

1422
01:28:25,599 --> 01:28:29,000
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

1423
01:28:35,676 --> 01:28:38,474
You should not have come back.

1424
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:06,968
Didn't we just leave this party?

1425
01:29:08,642 --> 01:29:09,870
What kept you?

1426
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:10,876
We, uh, ran into some old friends.

1427
01:29:10,945 --> 01:29:11,877
The ship all right?

1428
01:29:11,946 --> 01:29:13,470
It seems OK,
if we can get to it.

1429
01:29:13,547 --> 01:29:15,640
I just hope the old man got
the tractor beam out of commission.

1430
01:29:30,164 --> 01:29:31,392
Leia: Look!

1431
01:29:35,002 --> 01:29:36,902
Come on, R2, we're going.

1432
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:38,666
<i>[Beep Beep]</i>

1433
01:29:38,739 --> 01:29:39,831
Now's our chance! Go!

1434
01:29:43,677 --> 01:29:44,666
Ben?

1435
01:30:00,194 --> 01:30:01,923
No!

1436
01:30:10,004 --> 01:30:10,936
Come on!

1437
01:30:11,005 --> 01:30:12,165
Leia: Come on!

1438
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:13,729
Come on!

1439
01:30:13,808 --> 01:30:15,002
Luke, it's too late!

1440
01:30:15,075 --> 01:30:16,872
Han: Blast the door, kid!

1441
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,886
Obi-Wan: <i>Run, Luke, run!</i>

1442
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:33,859
I hope that old man got that
tractor beam out of commission...

1443
01:30:33,928 --> 01:30:36,556
or this is gonna be a real short trip.
OK Hit it!

1444
01:30:46,974 --> 01:30:48,908
Aargh!

1445
01:31:07,094 --> 01:31:09,562
We're coming up
on their sentry ships.

1446
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:11,120
Hold them off.

1447
01:31:11,198 --> 01:31:14,895
Angle the deflector shields
while I charge up the main guns.

1448
01:31:22,443 --> 01:31:24,934
I can't believe he's gone.

1449
01:31:27,581 --> 01:31:30,072
There wasn't anything
you could have done.

1450
01:31:30,150 --> 01:31:33,119
Come on, buddy.
We're not out of this yet.

1451
01:31:49,203 --> 01:31:52,263
You in, kid?
OK, stay sharp.

1452
01:32:03,117 --> 01:32:04,243
Here they come.

1453
01:32:22,236 --> 01:32:24,101
They're coming in too fast!

1454
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:33,603
We've lost the lateral controls!

1455
01:32:33,681 --> 01:32:35,945
Don't worry.
She'll hold together.

1456
01:32:37,451 --> 01:32:39,442
Hear me, baby?
Hold together.

1457
01:32:56,537 --> 01:32:57,504
Ha ha!

1458
01:33:01,575 --> 01:33:03,167
Got him! I got him!

1459
01:33:03,243 --> 01:33:05,643
Great, kid!
Don't get cocky.

1460
01:33:06,814 --> 01:33:08,577
There's still two more
of them out there!

1461
01:33:42,483 --> 01:33:43,848
That's it! We did it!

1462
01:33:43,917 --> 01:33:46,181
We did it!

1463
01:33:46,253 --> 01:33:48,813
Help! I think I'm melting!
This is all your fault!

1464
01:33:48,889 --> 01:33:51,824
<i>[Whistle Bleep Blip]</i>

1465
01:33:56,730 --> 01:33:58,163
Are they away?

1466
01:33:58,232 --> 01:34:01,326
They've just made the jump
into hyperspace.

1467
01:34:01,402 --> 01:34:05,771
You're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

1468
01:34:05,839 --> 01:34:08,569
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.

1469
01:34:08,642 --> 01:34:10,405
This had better work.

1470
01:34:10,577 --> 01:34:13,307
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

1471
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:16,543
You know, sometimes
I amaze even myself.

1472
01:34:16,617 --> 01:34:18,915
That doesn't sound too hard.

1473
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:20,351
They let us go.

1474
01:34:20,421 --> 01:34:21,718
It's the only explanation...

1475
01:34:21,789 --> 01:34:23,381
for the ease of our escape.

1476
01:34:23,457 --> 01:34:24,583
Easy? You call that easy?

1477
01:34:24,658 --> 01:34:25,682
They're tracking us.

1478
01:34:25,759 --> 01:34:27,454
Not this ship, sister.

1479
01:34:27,528 --> 01:34:31,259
At least the information
in R2 is still intact.

1480
01:34:31,331 --> 01:34:32,992
What's so important?
What's he carrying?

1481
01:34:33,067 --> 01:34:36,002
The technical readouts
of that battle station.

1482
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:38,664
I only hope that
when the data's analyzed...

1483
01:34:38,739 --> 01:34:40,400
a weakness can be found.

1484
01:34:40,474 --> 01:34:41,998
It's not over yet.

1485
01:34:42,076 --> 01:34:43,873
It is for me, sister.

1486
01:34:43,944 --> 01:34:45,707
Look, I ain't in this
for your revolution...

1487
01:34:45,779 --> 01:34:47,644
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

1488
01:34:47,715 --> 01:34:48,977
I expect to be well paid.

1489
01:34:49,049 --> 01:34:50,277
I'm in it for the money.

1490
01:34:50,350 --> 01:34:52,375
You needn't worry
about your reward.

1491
01:34:52,453 --> 01:34:54,080
If money is all that you love...

1492
01:34:54,154 --> 01:34:56,645
then that's what you'll receive.

1493
01:34:58,659 --> 01:35:00,627
Your friend is quite a mercenary.

1494
01:35:00,694 --> 01:35:02,958
I wonder if he really cares
about anything...

1495
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:04,588
or anybody.

1496
01:35:04,665 --> 01:35:06,155
I care.

1497
01:35:12,673 --> 01:35:15,233
So...

1498
01:35:15,309 --> 01:35:16,833
what do you think of her, Han?

1499
01:35:16,910 --> 01:35:18,810
I'm trying not to, kid.

1500
01:35:18,879 --> 01:35:20,938
Good.

1501
01:35:24,284 --> 01:35:27,253
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

1502
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:30,789
I don't know.
What do you think?

1503
01:35:30,858 --> 01:35:32,416
You think a princess
and a guy like me...

1504
01:35:32,493 --> 01:35:34,290
No!

1505
01:36:20,541 --> 01:36:21,473
You're safe.

1506
01:36:21,542 --> 01:36:22,873
When we heard about Alderaan...

1507
01:36:22,943 --> 01:36:24,069
we feared the worst.

1508
01:36:24,144 --> 01:36:25,975
We have no time
for sorrows, Commander.

1509
01:36:26,046 --> 01:36:27,877
You must use the information
in this R2 unit...

1510
01:36:27,948 --> 01:36:28,937
to help plan the attack.

1511
01:36:29,016 --> 01:36:30,506
It's our only hope.

1512
01:36:51,238 --> 01:36:52,170
[Beep]

1513
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:53,399
Yes.

1514
01:36:53,473 --> 01:36:54,770
<i>We're approaching</i>
<i>the planet Yavin.</i>

1515
01:36:54,842 --> 01:36:57,106
<i>The rebel base is on a moon</i>
<i>on the far side.</i>

1516
01:36:57,177 --> 01:36:59,771
<i>We are preparing</i>
<i>to orbit the planet.</i>

1517
01:37:07,955 --> 01:37:10,549
The battle station
is heavily shielded...

1518
01:37:10,624 --> 01:37:12,455
and carries a firepower...

1519
01:37:12,526 --> 01:37:14,494
greater than half the starfleet.

1520
01:37:14,561 --> 01:37:18,930
Its defenses are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.

1521
01:37:18,999 --> 01:37:24,301
A small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defense.

1522
01:37:24,371 --> 01:37:26,566
Pilot: Pardon me for asking, sir...

1523
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:29,632
but what good are snub fighters
going to be against that?

1524
01:37:29,710 --> 01:37:33,373
The Empire doesn't consider
a small, one-man fighter...

1525
01:37:33,447 --> 01:37:34,414
to be any threat...

1526
01:37:34,481 --> 01:37:37,279
or they'd have a tighter defense.

1527
01:37:37,351 --> 01:37:40,445
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia...

1528
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:43,819
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

1529
01:37:43,891 --> 01:37:46,655
The approach will not be easy.

1530
01:37:46,727 --> 01:37:49,924
You're required to maneuver
straight down this trench...

1531
01:37:49,997 --> 01:37:53,398
and skim the surface
to this point.

1532
01:37:53,467 --> 01:37:56,197
The target area
is only 2 meters wide.

1533
01:37:56,270 --> 01:37:58,465
It's a small thermal exhaust port...

1534
01:37:58,538 --> 01:38:01,098
right below the main port.

1535
01:38:01,174 --> 01:38:04,337
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

1536
01:38:04,411 --> 01:38:07,107
A precise hit will start
a chain reaction...

1537
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:09,444
which should destroy the station.

1538
01:38:09,516 --> 01:38:13,145
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

1539
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:14,585
The shaft is ray-shielded...

1540
01:38:14,655 --> 01:38:16,418
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

1541
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:18,981
That's impossible,
even for a computer.

1542
01:38:19,059 --> 01:38:22,517
It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye
womp rats in my T-16 back home.

1543
01:38:22,596 --> 01:38:25,030
Luke: They're not much bigger
than 2 meters.

1544
01:38:25,098 --> 01:38:28,534
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

1545
01:38:36,543 --> 01:38:39,034
<i>Orbiting the planet</i>
<i>at maximum velocity.</i>

1546
01:38:39,112 --> 01:38:41,080
<i>The moon with the rebel base...</i>

1547
01:38:41,148 --> 01:38:43,514
<i>will be in range in 30 minutes.</i>

1548
01:38:43,583 --> 01:38:45,949
This will be a day long remembered.

1549
01:38:46,019 --> 01:38:48,487
It has seen the end of Kenobi...

1550
01:38:48,555 --> 01:38:53,117
and will soon see the end
of the rebellion.

1551
01:38:56,630 --> 01:39:00,031
<i>All flight crews,</i>
<i>man your stations.</i>

1552
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:03,035
<i>All flight crews,</i>
<i>man your stations.</i>

1553
01:39:05,405 --> 01:39:08,533
So... you got your reward
and you're just leaving, then?

1554
01:39:08,608 --> 01:39:10,098
That's right. Yeah.

1555
01:39:10,177 --> 01:39:14,170
I got some old debts I got
to pay off with this stuff.

1556
01:39:14,247 --> 01:39:15,771
And even if I didn't...

1557
01:39:15,849 --> 01:39:18,545
you don't think I'd be fool enough
to stick around here, do ya?

1558
01:39:18,618 --> 01:39:20,279
Why don't you come with us?

1559
01:39:20,354 --> 01:39:22,254
You're pretty good in a fight.
We could use ya.

1560
01:39:22,322 --> 01:39:25,257
Come on. Why don't you
take a look around?

1561
01:39:25,325 --> 01:39:26,690
You know what's about to happen...

1562
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:28,091
what they're up against.

1563
01:39:28,161 --> 01:39:29,560
They could use
a good pilot like you.

1564
01:39:29,629 --> 01:39:30,994
You're turning
your back on them.

1565
01:39:31,064 --> 01:39:33,498
What good's a reward
if you ain't around to use it?

1566
01:39:33,567 --> 01:39:35,467
Besides, attacking
that battle station...

1567
01:39:35,535 --> 01:39:36,661
ain't my idea of courage.

1568
01:39:36,737 --> 01:39:39,467
It's more like... suicide.

1569
01:39:40,907 --> 01:39:41,839
All right.

1570
01:39:41,908 --> 01:39:44,138
Take care of yourself, Han.

1571
01:39:44,211 --> 01:39:46,907
I guess that's what
you're best at, isn't it?

1572
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:48,345
Hey, Luke.

1573
01:39:51,618 --> 01:39:54,052
May the Force be with you.

1574
01:39:56,990 --> 01:39:58,014
Argh!

1575
01:39:58,091 --> 01:40:00,423
Argh!

1576
01:40:00,494 --> 01:40:01,859
What are you looking at?

1577
01:40:01,928 --> 01:40:03,725
I know what I'm doing.

1578
01:40:08,111 --> 01:40:11,603
<i>All pilots to your stations.</i>

1579
01:40:11,681 --> 01:40:13,672
<i>All pilots to your stations.</i>

1580
01:40:18,888 --> 01:40:20,378
What's wrong?

1581
01:40:20,457 --> 01:40:21,822
Oh, it's Han.

1582
01:40:21,891 --> 01:40:24,325
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.

1583
01:40:24,394 --> 01:40:26,021
He's got to follow his own path.

1584
01:40:26,096 --> 01:40:27,996
No one can choose it for him.

1585
01:40:28,064 --> 01:40:32,194
I only wish Ben were here.

1586
01:40:39,509 --> 01:40:41,500
<i>Open main launch tubes.</i>

1587
01:40:43,113 --> 01:40:45,980
<i>Main launch tubes opening, sir.</i>

1588
01:40:51,421 --> 01:40:53,150
Hey, this R2 unit of yours
seems a bit beat up.

1589
01:40:53,223 --> 01:40:54,383
You want a new one?

1590
01:40:54,457 --> 01:40:55,924
Not on your life.

1591
01:40:55,992 --> 01:40:57,619
That little droid and I have
been through a lot together.

1592
01:40:57,694 --> 01:40:58,718
You OK, R2?

1593
01:40:58,795 --> 01:41:00,319
<i>[Blip Beep]</i>

1594
01:41:00,396 --> 01:41:01,624
Good.

1595
01:41:02,832 --> 01:41:06,165
<i>Gold squadron,</i>
<i>begin takeoff procedure.</i>

1596
01:41:06,236 --> 01:41:08,864
Hang on tight, R2.
You've got to come back.

1597
01:41:08,938 --> 01:41:11,065
<i>[Beep Blip Beep]</i>

1598
01:41:11,141 --> 01:41:13,166
You wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?

1599
01:41:13,243 --> 01:41:14,801
<i>[Beep Beep Beep]</i>

1600
01:42:01,491 --> 01:42:05,723

01:42:16,172 --> 01:42:17,696
<i>Standby alert.</i>

1602

<i>Death Star approaching.</i>

<i>Estimated time to firing range,</i>

01:42:36,392 --> 01:42:37,620
All wings report in.

1605
01:42:37,694 --> 01:42:38,661
Red 10 standing by.

1606
01:42:38,728 --> 01:42:39,786
Red Seven standing by.

1607
01:42:39,862 --> 01:42:40,988
Red Three standing by.

1608
01:42:41,064 --> 01:42:42,292
Red Six standing by.

1609
01:42:42,365 --> 01:42:43,832
Red Nine standing by.

1610
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:44,889
Red Two standing by.

1611
01:42:44,968 --> 01:42:45,992
Red 11 standing by.

1612
01:42:46,069 --> 01:42:47,934
Red Five standing by.

01:42:48,004 --> 01:42:49,232
<i>[Beep Beep]</i>

1614
01:42:49,305 --> 01:42:51,239
Lock S-foils in attack position.

1615
01:42:55,478 --> 01:42:57,503
We're passing through
the magnetic field.

1616
01:42:57,580 --> 01:42:58,604
Hold tight.

1617
01:42:58,681 --> 01:43:01,946
Switch your deflectors on.
Double front.

1618
01:43:04,921 --> 01:43:06,718
Look at the size of that thing!

1619
01:43:06,789 --> 01:43:09,417
Cut the chatter, Red Two.
Accelerate to attack speed.

1620
01:43:12,795 --> 01:43:13,853
This is it, boys.

1621
01:43:13,930 --> 01:43:15,557
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1622
01:43:15,632 --> 01:43:16,860
I copy, Gold Leader.

1623
01:43:16,933 --> 01:43:18,491
We're starting for
the target shaft now.

1624
01:43:18,568 --> 01:43:19,535
We're in position.

1625
01:43:19,602 --> 01:43:20,796
I'm going to cut across the axis...

1626
01:43:20,870 --> 01:43:22,064
and try and draw their fire.

1627
01:43:36,486 --> 01:43:38,147
Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.

1628
01:43:38,221 --> 01:43:39,779
I see it. Stay low.

1629
01:43:47,196 --> 01:43:48,720
This is Red Five. I'm going in.

1630
01:43:53,202 --> 01:43:54,328
Luke, pull up!

1631
01:43:56,005 --> 01:43:56,937
Are you all right?

1632
01:43:57,006 --> 01:43:58,337
I got a little cooked, but I'm O.K.

1633
01:44:04,213 --> 01:44:05,908
We count 30 rebel ships, Lord Vader...

1634
01:44:05,982 --> 01:44:06,949
but they're so small...

1635
01:44:07,016 --> 01:44:08,210
they're evading our turbolasers.

1636
01:44:08,284 --> 01:44:10,275
We'll have to destroy
them ship to ship.

1637
01:44:10,353 --> 01:44:12,378
Get the crews to their fighters.

1638
01:44:14,991 --> 01:44:17,186
Watch yourself.
There's a lot of fire coming...

1639
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:19,228
from the right side
of that deflection tower.

1640
01:44:19,295 --> 01:44:20,193
I'm on it.

1641
01:44:20,263 --> 01:44:22,356
I'm going in.
Cover me, Porkins.

1642
01:44:22,432 --> 01:44:23,729
I'm right with you,
Red Three.

1643
01:44:30,106 --> 01:44:31,403
I've got a problem here.

1644
01:44:31,474 --> 01:44:32,406
Eject.

1645
01:44:32,475 --> 01:44:33,407
I can hold it.

1646
01:44:33,476 --> 01:44:34,408
Pull up!

1647
01:44:34,477 --> 01:44:37,241
No, I'm all... Aah!

1648
01:44:39,716 --> 01:44:41,843
<i>The rebel base</i>
<i>will be in firing range...</i>

1649
01:44:41,918 --> 01:44:43,442
<i>in seven minutes.</i>

1650
01:44:46,522 --> 01:44:49,389
Obi-Wan:
<i>Luke, trust your feelings.</i>

1651
01:44:57,133 --> 01:45:01,194
Squad leaders, we've
picked up a new group of signals.

1652
01:45:01,270 --> 01:45:02,965
Enemy fighters coming your way.

1653
01:45:03,039 --> 01:45:04,734
My scope's negative.
I don't see anything.

1654
01:45:04,807 --> 01:45:06,001
Pick up your visual scanning.

1655
01:45:06,075 --> 01:45:07,064
Here they come.

1656
01:45:10,279 --> 01:45:12,008
Watch it. You've got one
on your tail.

1657
01:45:17,353 --> 01:45:18,342
I'm hit!

1658
01:45:19,689 --> 01:45:20,883
You've picked one up!
Watch it!

1659
01:45:20,957 --> 01:45:22,288
I can't see it!

1660
01:45:24,227 --> 01:45:25,956
He's on me tight.
I can't shake him!

1661
01:45:27,663 --> 01:45:28,652
I'll be right there.

1662
01:45:40,810 --> 01:45:42,744
Several fighters have broken off...

1663
01:45:42,812 --> 01:45:45,303
from the main group.
Come with me.

1664
01:45:48,251 --> 01:45:50,776
Fall in! Fall in!

1665
01:45:50,853 --> 01:45:51,877
Watch your back, Luke.

1666
01:45:51,954 --> 01:45:52,886
Watch your back.

1667
01:45:52,955 --> 01:45:54,320
Fighters above you, coming in.

1668
01:46:00,630 --> 01:46:01,756
I'm hit, but not bad.

1669
01:46:01,831 --> 01:46:03,264
R2, see what you can do with it.

1670
01:46:03,332 --> 01:46:05,562
Hang on back there.

1671
01:46:05,635 --> 01:46:08,229
Red Six, can you see Red Five?

1672
01:46:08,304 --> 01:46:09,828
There's a heavy fire zone.

1673
01:46:09,906 --> 01:46:10,804
Red Five, where are you?

1674
01:46:10,873 --> 01:46:12,340
I can't shake him!

1675
01:46:16,379 --> 01:46:17,869
I'm on him, Luke. Hold on.

1676
01:46:21,117 --> 01:46:22,744
Blast it, Biggs! Where are you?

1677
01:46:29,759 --> 01:46:30,885
Thanks, Wedge.

1678
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:32,222
Good shooting, Wedge.

1679
01:46:32,295 --> 01:46:34,559
Red Leader,
this is Gold Leader.

1680
01:46:34,630 --> 01:46:35,756
We're starting our attack run.

1681
01:46:37,567 --> 01:46:39,967
I copy, Gold Leader.
Move into position.

1682
01:46:42,371 --> 01:46:44,669
Stay in attack formation.

1683
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:47,641
The exhaust port
is marked and locked in.

1684
01:46:53,483 --> 01:46:54,745
Switch all power...

1685
01:46:54,817 --> 01:46:57,308
to front deflector screen.

1686
01:46:57,386 --> 01:46:58,876
Switch all power...

1687
01:46:58,955 --> 01:47:00,923
to front deflector screen.

1688
01:47:04,660 --> 01:47:06,423
How many guns do you think,
Gold Five?

1689
01:47:06,496 --> 01:47:07,690
Say about 20 guns...

1690
01:47:07,763 --> 01:47:09,754
some on the surface,
some on the towers.

1691
01:47:09,832 --> 01:47:12,699
<i>Death Star will be in range</i>
<i>in five minutes.</i>

1692
01:47:14,770 --> 01:47:17,830
Switch to targeting computer.

1693
01:47:20,276 --> 01:47:22,335
Computer locked.
Getting a signal.

1694
01:47:24,347 --> 01:47:26,838
The guns!
They've stopped!

1695
01:47:28,518 --> 01:47:29,951
Stabilize your rear deflectors.

1696
01:47:30,019 --> 01:47:31,714
Watch for enemy fighters.

1697
01:47:31,787 --> 01:47:33,618
They're coming in!
Three marks at 210.

1698
01:47:35,591 --> 01:47:37,786
I'll take them myself.
Cover me.

1699
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:39,157
Yes, sir.

1700
01:47:53,676 --> 01:47:54,802
It's no good.
I can't maneuver.

1701
01:47:54,877 --> 01:47:55,935
Stay on target.

1702
01:47:56,012 --> 01:47:56,944
We're too close.

1703
01:47:57,013 --> 01:47:58,105
Stay on target.

1704
01:47:59,882 --> 01:48:00,871
Loosen up!

1705
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:06,718
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

1706
01:48:06,789 --> 01:48:08,086
I copy, Gold Leader.

1707
01:48:08,157 --> 01:48:09,146
They came from behind.

1708
01:48:13,829 --> 01:48:15,763
We've analyzed their attack, sir...

1709
01:48:15,831 --> 01:48:18,265
and there is a danger.

1710
01:48:18,334 --> 01:48:20,802
Should I have your
ship standing by?

1711
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:23,805
Evacuate in our moment of triumph?

1712
01:48:23,873 --> 01:48:25,636
I think you overestimate
their chances.

1713
01:48:25,708 --> 01:48:28,438
<i>Rebel base, three minutes</i>
<i>and closing.</i>

1714
01:48:28,511 --> 01:48:31,036
Red boys, this is Red Leader.

1715
01:48:31,113 --> 01:48:32,546
Rendezvous at mark 6.1.

1716
01:48:32,615 --> 01:48:34,810
This is Red Two flying toward you.

1717
01:48:34,884 --> 01:48:36,818
Red Three standing by.

1718
01:48:36,886 --> 01:48:38,513
Red Leader, this is Base One.

1719
01:48:38,588 --> 01:48:40,146
Keep half your group
out of range...

1720
01:48:40,222 --> 01:48:41,416
for the next run.

1721
01:48:41,490 --> 01:48:43,981
Copy, Base One. Luke,
take Red Two and Three.

1722
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:47,393
Hold up here and wait for
my signal to start your run.

1723
01:48:55,204 --> 01:48:57,035
This is it!

1724
01:49:01,611 --> 01:49:03,704
We should be able to see it by now.

1725
01:49:05,381 --> 01:49:07,178
Keep your eyes open
for those fighters.

1726
01:49:08,918 --> 01:49:10,112
There's too much interference.

1727
01:49:10,186 --> 01:49:11,380
Red Five, can you see them
from where you are?

1728
01:49:11,454 --> 01:49:13,422
No sign of any...
Wait. Coming in.35.

1729
01:49:13,489 --> 01:49:14,478
I see them.

1730
01:49:15,992 --> 01:49:17,084
I'm in range.

1731
01:49:18,361 --> 01:49:19,350
Target's coming up.

1732
01:49:22,665 --> 01:49:24,826
Just hold them off
for a few seconds.

1733
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:27,232
Close up formation.

1734
01:49:28,571 --> 01:49:30,766
Almost there.

1735
01:49:39,849 --> 01:49:41,817
You'd better let her loose.
They're right behind me.

1736
01:49:41,884 --> 01:49:43,112
Almost there.

1737
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:46,181
I can't hold them.

1738
01:49:47,423 --> 01:49:49,118
Aah!

1739
01:49:54,397 --> 01:49:55,887
It's away!

1740
01:49:59,702 --> 01:50:01,260
Man: It's a hit!

1741
01:50:01,337 --> 01:50:03,430
Negative, negative.
It didn't go in.

1742
01:50:03,506 --> 01:50:06,168
It just impacted on the surface.

1743
01:50:12,648 --> 01:50:14,309
Red Leader, we're right above you.

1744
01:50:14,383 --> 01:50:16,715
Turn to.05.
We'll cover for you.

1745
01:50:16,786 --> 01:50:20,313
Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.

1746
01:50:20,389 --> 01:50:22,653
Get set up for your attack run.

1747
01:50:27,296 --> 01:50:29,025
Aah!

1748
01:50:35,438 --> 01:50:38,601
<i>Rebel base,</i>
<i>one minute and closing.</i>

1749
01:50:38,674 --> 01:50:40,972
Luke: Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.

1750
01:50:41,043 --> 01:50:42,874
We're going in full throttle.

1751
01:50:42,945 --> 01:50:44,378
That ought to keep those
fighters off our back.

1752
01:50:44,447 --> 01:50:46,574
Right with you, boss.

1753
01:50:46,649 --> 01:50:48,981
Luke, at that speed, will you be able
to pull out in time?

1754
01:50:49,051 --> 01:50:51,076
It'll be just like
Beggars Canyon back home.

1755
01:50:58,394 --> 01:51:00,658
We'll stay back
far enough to cover you.

1756
01:51:00,730 --> 01:51:01,719
My scope shows the tower...

1757
01:51:01,797 --> 01:51:03,321
but I can't see the exhaust port.

1758
01:51:03,399 --> 01:51:04,866
Are you sure
the computer can hit it?

1759
01:51:08,337 --> 01:51:10,362

R2, that stabilizer's
broken loose again.

1764
01:51:22,952 --> 01:51:24,283
See if you can't lock it down.

Get clear, Wedge.
You can't do any more good back there.

Sorry.

1770
01:51:50,279 --> 01:51:52,213
Let him go.
Stay on the leader.

1771
01:51:55,184 --> 01:51:56,674
Hurry, Luke. They're coming in
much faster this time.

1772
01:51:56,752 --> 01:51:57,980
We can't hold them.

1773
01:52:01,557 --> 01:52:02,956
