2
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,359
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

3
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:04,563
Tell them we wish
to board at once.

4
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,300
With all due respect,

5
00:02:07,408 --> 00:02:10,845
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.

6
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:12,846
Yes, of course.

7
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:16,041
As you know, our blockade
is perfectly legal,

8
00:02:16,184 --> 00:02:20,212
and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.

9
00:02:42,715 --> 00:02:45,343
I'm TC-14
at your service.

10
00:02:45,484 --> 00:02:47,384
This way, please.

11
00:02:53,493 --> 00:02:56,588
We are greatly honored
by your visit, Ambassadors.

12
00:02:56,697 --> 00:02:58,597
Make yourselves comfortable.

13
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:01,862
My master will be
with you shortly.

14
00:03:04,873 --> 00:03:07,171
I have a bad feeling
about this.

15
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:10,301
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

16
00:03:10,412 --> 00:03:14,349
It's something...
elsewhere, elusive.

17
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,850
Don't center on
your anxieties, Obi-Wan.

18
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:20,117
Keep your concentration
here and now, where it belongs.

19
00:03:20,257 --> 00:03:23,090
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

20
00:03:23,193 --> 00:03:25,184
But not at the expense
of the moment.

21
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:28,299
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

22
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,300
Yes, Master.

23
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:36,168
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

24
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:38,368
These Federation types
are cowards.

25
00:03:38,477 --> 00:03:41,344
The negotiations
will be short.

26
00:03:41,447 --> 00:03:44,747
What?
What did you say?

27
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:47,820
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

28
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:49,821
I knew it.

29
00:03:49,923 --> 00:03:52,154
They're here
to force a settlement.

30
00:03:52,293 --> 00:03:56,320
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

31
00:03:56,464 --> 00:03:58,365
Are you brain-dead?

32
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:02,369
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.

33
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:04,371
Send a droid.

34
00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:11,678
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

35
00:04:11,781 --> 00:04:16,344
No. I sense an unusual amount of fear for
something as trivial as this trade dispute.

36
00:04:27,332 --> 00:04:29,233
What is it?

37
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,963
This scheme of yours
has failed, Lord Sidious.

38
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,666
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

39
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:40,611
Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.

40
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,474
This turn of events
is unfortunate.

41
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:48,682
We must accelerate our plans.
Begin landing your troops.

42
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,522
My lord, is that legal?

43
00:04:52,628 --> 00:04:54,926
I will make it legal.

44
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,362
And the Jedi?

45
00:04:57,466 --> 00:05:01,904
The chancellor should never have brought
them into this. Kill them immediately.

46
00:05:02,005 --> 00:05:06,305
Yes. Yes, my lord.
Uh, as you wish.

47
00:05:08,146 --> 00:05:09,977
Captain, look!

48
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:12,447
Shields up!

49
00:05:15,954 --> 00:05:17,819
Sorry.

50
00:05:19,558 --> 00:05:21,458
Dioxis.

51
00:05:26,299 --> 00:05:28,927
They must be dead by now.

52
00:05:29,035 --> 00:05:32,972
Destroy what's left of them.

53
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:42,282
Oh! Excuse me.

54
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,353
- Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
- Roger, roger.

55
00:05:45,453 --> 00:05:47,945
Uh-oh. Blast them.

56
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:55,262
What is going on down there?

57
00:05:55,365 --> 00:05:57,333
We lost the transmission,
sir.

58
00:06:01,805 --> 00:06:04,832
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

59
00:06:04,943 --> 00:06:07,935
Well, no, but I don't...
Seal off the bridge.

60
00:06:08,046 --> 00:06:10,743
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

61
00:06:10,883 --> 00:06:12,851
I want droidekas
up here at once!

62
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:15,476
We will not survive this.

63
00:06:27,068 --> 00:06:29,468
Close the blast doors!

64
00:06:34,443 --> 00:06:37,276
That will hold them.

65
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:48,518
They are still
coming through.

66
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,526
This is impossible!

67
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:57,831
Where are those droidekas?

68
00:06:59,437 --> 00:07:01,166
Master! Destroyers!

69
00:07:07,613 --> 00:07:10,343
They have shield generators!

70
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:13,146
It's a standoff.
Let's go.

71
00:07:17,357 --> 00:07:19,848
They're no match
for droidekas.

72
00:07:19,993 --> 00:07:24,431
Sir! They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

73
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:35,837
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

74
00:07:37,614 --> 00:07:40,276
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

75
00:07:40,383 --> 00:07:43,511
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

76
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,558
Let's split up. Stow aboard separate
ships and meet down on the planet.

77
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:51,561
You were right
about one thing, Master.

78
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:55,155
The negotiations were short.

79
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:58,734
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

80
00:07:58,837 --> 00:08:00,931
It's Queen Amidala herself.

81
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,737
At last we are
getting results.

82
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:07,804
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

83
00:08:07,915 --> 00:08:11,043
You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.

84
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:14,882
Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.

85
00:08:14,989 --> 00:08:17,549
I was not aware
of such failure.

86
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:20,389
I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...

87
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:23,191
and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.

88
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:25,630
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.

89
00:08:25,735 --> 00:08:28,135
You must be mistaken.

90
00:08:28,237 --> 00:08:30,262
Beware, Viceroy.

91
00:08:30,373 --> 00:08:33,070
The Federation
has gone too far this time.

92
00:08:33,176 --> 00:08:37,237
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

93
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:39,839
You assume too much.

94
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:42,852
We will see.

95
00:08:42,954 --> 00:08:46,982
- She's right. The senate will never...
- It's too late now.

96
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:50,061
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

97
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:54,566
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

98
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:03,843
Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?

99
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:06,105
How could that be true?

100
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:10,583
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

101
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:14,416
It must...
handiwork... negotiate... ambassadors...

102
00:09:14,523 --> 00:09:17,185
- Nobody would...
- Senator Palpatine.

103
00:09:17,293 --> 00:09:19,193
What's happening?

104
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:21,195
Check the transmission
generator.

105
00:09:21,297 --> 00:09:26,201
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

106
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:28,600
The Federation would not
dare go that far.

107
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:32,573
The senate would revoke their
trade franchise, and they'd be finished.

108
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:35,544
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

109
00:09:35,647 --> 00:09:38,878
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

110
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:41,316
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

111
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,089
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

112
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:49,561
Our security volunteers will be no match
against a battle-hardened Federation army.

113
00:09:51,131 --> 00:09:55,795
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

114
00:10:31,276 --> 00:10:34,404
- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship,

115
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:36,640
and there is no trace
of the Jedi.

116
00:10:36,782 --> 00:10:39,546
They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.

117
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:42,120
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

118
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:47,091
Use caution.
These Jedi are not to be underestimated.

119
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:02,970
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

120
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:06,070
Get down!

121
00:11:06,216 --> 00:11:08,411
Ay-yee-yee! Wha!

122
00:11:15,026 --> 00:11:18,621
Was'n dat?
Hey, wait!

123
00:11:18,796 --> 00:11:20,627
Oh, mooie-mooie!
I love you!

124
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:22,927
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

125
00:11:23,035 --> 00:11:26,732
- I spake.
- The ability to speak does not make you intelligent.

126
00:11:26,838 --> 00:11:29,740
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

127
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:32,902
Mesa culled JarJar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

128
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:35,139
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

129
00:11:35,248 --> 00:11:38,150
'Tis demanded
by the gods, it 'tis.

130
00:11:38,252 --> 00:11:41,710
- Oh, no! Whoo!
- Stay down!

131
00:11:47,696 --> 00:11:50,290
You saved my again.

132
00:11:50,398 --> 00:11:52,298
- What's this?
- A local.

133
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,132
- Let's get out of here before more droids show up.
- More?

134
00:11:56,238 --> 00:11:58,468
"More" did you spake?

135
00:11:58,574 --> 00:12:03,444
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

136
00:12:03,547 --> 00:12:06,778
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.

137
00:12:08,385 --> 00:12:10,286
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

138
00:12:10,388 --> 00:12:14,552
- Can you take us there?
- Uh, on second thought, no.

139
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,161
- Not really, no.
- No?

140
00:12:17,296 --> 00:12:19,389
'Tis embarrassing,

141
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:23,467
but, uh, my afraid
my've been banished.

142
00:12:23,602 --> 00:12:26,731
My forgotten.
Da bosses would do terrible tings to me.

143
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,934
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

144
00:12:30,043 --> 00:12:33,036
- You hear that?
- Yah.

145
00:12:33,147 --> 00:12:36,913
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

146
00:12:37,018 --> 00:12:39,578
If they find us,
they will crush us,

147
00:12:39,688 --> 00:12:44,250
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

148
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:48,319
Oh. Yousa point
is well seen.

149
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:50,797
This way. Hurry!

150
00:12:56,073 --> 00:12:59,372
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

151
00:12:59,476 --> 00:13:01,376
Ah, my warning you.

152
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:05,609
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

153
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:09,050
Oh, don't worry. This hasn't
been our day for warm welcomes.

154
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:13,057
Ar, ar, ar!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

155
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,933

Ohh.

164
00:14:41,158 --> 00:14:43,524
Ay, ay.

165
00:14:43,627 --> 00:14:46,756
How wude.

166
00:14:53,405 --> 00:14:57,842
Tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk!
Yousa cannot bees hair.

167
00:14:57,943 --> 00:15:02,472
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

168
00:15:02,615 --> 00:15:07,518
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

169
00:15:07,621 --> 00:15:11,250
Wesa no like da Naboo.
Tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk.

170
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:14,156
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

171
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:17,197
Day tink day brains so big.

172
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:21,429
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

173
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:23,835
Mesa no tink so.

174
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,841
Day not know of uss-en.

175
00:15:26,943 --> 00:15:29,912
You and the Naboo form
a symbiont circle.

176
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,414
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

177
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:38,351
Wesa no carrrre-nn
about da Naboo.

178
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:40,981
Then speed us on our way.

179
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,616
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

180
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:46,560
We could use a transport.

181
00:15:46,665 --> 00:15:49,532
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

182
00:15:49,635 --> 00:15:52,695
- Hmm?
- Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

183
00:15:52,805 --> 00:15:57,539
'tis goen through
the planet core.

184
00:15:57,644 --> 00:15:59,544
Now...

185
00:15:59,646 --> 00:16:01,477
go.

186
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:03,846
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.

187
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:06,010
Master, what's a bongo?

188
00:16:06,153 --> 00:16:08,121
A transport, I hope.

189
00:16:08,256 --> 00:16:10,316
Deysa setten yousa up.

190
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:14,088
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

191
00:16:14,196 --> 00:16:18,395
Mmm... any help here
would be hot.

192
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:21,602
Master, we're short on time.

193
00:16:21,704 --> 00:16:25,333
We'll need a navigator
to get us through the planet's core.

194
00:16:25,441 --> 00:16:27,410
This Gungan may be of help.

195
00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:32,573
What is to become
of JarJar Binks here?

196
00:16:32,683 --> 00:16:37,621
Hisen soon to be
pune-ished.

197
00:16:37,722 --> 00:16:39,952
- Ohh.
- I saved his life.

198
00:16:40,091 --> 00:16:42,560
He owes me what you call
a " life-debt."

199
00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:46,563
Your gods demand that his life
belongs to me now.

200
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,033
Binkssssss,

201
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:52,731
yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?

202
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:56,240
Mm, uh-huh.

203
00:16:59,814 --> 00:17:01,645
Begone wit him!

204
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,720
Count me outta dis one.

205
00:17:06,822 --> 00:17:09,950
Better dead here
than dead in da core.

206
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:13,223
Yee gods!
What mesa sayin?

207
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,248
Dis is nutsen.
Oh, gooberfish!

208
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,619
- Why were you banished, JarJar?
- It's a longo tale-o,

209
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:42,787
buta small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

210
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:47,697
- You were banished because you were clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

211
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:04,881
Mesa caused mabbe one,
two-y lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

212
00:18:04,954 --> 00:18:07,048
Yud-say
boom da gassar,

213
00:18:07,157 --> 00:18:09,955
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.

214
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:17,100
Wuh-oh!

215
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:19,260
Big gooberfish!
Huge-o teeth!

216
00:18:30,116 --> 00:18:34,212
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

217
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:48,798
The invasion is on schedule,
my lord.

218
00:18:48,904 --> 00:18:51,896
I have the senate bogged down
in procedures.

219
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:56,468
They will have no choice but to accept
your control of the system.

220
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:01,313
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

221
00:19:01,418 --> 00:19:04,410
Queen Amidala
is young and naive.

222
00:19:04,521 --> 00:19:07,979
You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.

223
00:19:08,092 --> 00:19:09,993
Yes, my lord.

224
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:14,296
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

225
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:18,928
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

226
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:27,176
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

227
00:19:27,314 --> 00:19:30,078
Ohh, maxi big, da Force.

228
00:19:30,217 --> 00:19:33,016
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

229
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:35,021
We're losing power.

230
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:36,784
Ohhh, no!

231
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:44,961
Wesa dyin' here.

232
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:47,763
- Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet"?

233
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,863
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.

234
00:19:50,974 --> 00:19:55,912
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

235
00:19:57,214 --> 00:19:59,546
- Power's back.
- Huh?

236
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,709
Aah, monster's back!

237
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,924
Relax.

238
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:12,930
- Ohh.
- You overdid it.

239
00:20:27,882 --> 00:20:30,680
- Horrible.
- Head for that outcropping.

240
00:20:30,785 --> 00:20:33,777
Oh, boy.

241
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:11,187
Viceroy, we have
captured the queen.

242
00:21:11,331 --> 00:21:13,994
Ah, victory.

243
00:21:26,648 --> 00:21:29,641
Mmm, dis'n loverly.

244
00:21:34,824 --> 00:21:38,192
How will you explain
this invasion to the senate?

245
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:42,493
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

246
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:45,762
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

247
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:49,361
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

248
00:21:49,507 --> 00:21:53,638
In time, the suffering of your people will
persuade you to see our point of view.

249
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,914
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

250
00:21:57,016 --> 00:22:00,544
- Process them.
- Captain, take them to Camp 4.

251
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:02,554
Roger, roger.

252
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:45,495
Whoops!

253
00:22:45,603 --> 00:22:48,072
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

254
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:01,143
- We should leave the street, Your Highness.
- Get their weapons.

255
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:04,713
Whoa!
Yousa guys bombad!

256
00:23:06,794 --> 00:23:09,194
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.

257
00:23:09,297 --> 00:23:11,323
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

258
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,164
The negotiations
never took place.

259
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:15,668
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

260
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:19,208
- They've knocked out all our communications.
- Do you have transports?

261
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:21,709
In the main hangar.
This way.

262
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:29,411
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

263
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,081
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

264
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,285
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

265
00:23:36,395 --> 00:23:39,057
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

266
00:23:39,164 --> 00:23:42,931
They need her to sign a treaty to make this
invasion legal. They can't afford to kill her.

267
00:23:43,035 --> 00:23:45,195
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

268
00:23:45,271 --> 00:23:47,239
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

269
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,332
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.

270
00:23:49,443 --> 00:23:51,843
Our only hope is for
the senate to side with us.

271
00:23:51,945 --> 00:23:54,436
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

272
00:23:54,548 --> 00:23:58,508
Either choice presents
great danger... to us all.

273
00:23:58,653 --> 00:24:00,553
We are brave, Your Highness.

274
00:24:00,655 --> 00:24:03,920
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

275
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,494
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

276
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:09,325
Be careful, Governor.

277
00:24:18,241 --> 00:24:21,439
We'll need to free
those pilots.

278
00:24:21,546 --> 00:24:23,446
I'll deal with that.

279
00:24:26,951 --> 00:24:29,420
- Halt!
- I'm ambassador to the supreme chancellor.

280
00:24:29,521 --> 00:24:31,489
I'm taking these people
to Coruscant.

281
00:24:31,623 --> 00:24:34,854
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

282
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,589
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

283
00:24:37,697 --> 00:24:39,631
Uh, wait.
You're under arrest.

284
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,337
Come on. Move!

285
00:24:51,646 --> 00:24:54,274
Go!

286
00:25:18,176 --> 00:25:21,475
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

287
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:28,379
Hello, boyos.

288
00:25:33,793 --> 00:25:35,385
There's the blockade.

289
00:25:44,272 --> 00:25:47,504
The shield generator's been hit!

290
00:25:55,952 --> 00:25:57,544
How wude!

291
00:26:07,598 --> 00:26:09,190
We're losing droids fast.

292
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:12,633
If we can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

293
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:18,903
The shields are gone.

294
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:25,479
The power's back!

295
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:31,780
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

296
00:26:31,892 --> 00:26:34,453
Deflector shields up
at maximum.

297
00:26:44,073 --> 00:26:47,804
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

298
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,812
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

299
00:26:50,914 --> 00:26:53,109
Here, Master.
Tatooine.

300
00:26:53,216 --> 00:26:56,778
Small, out of the way, poor. The Trade
Federation have no presence there.

301
00:26:56,887 --> 00:26:58,752
How can you be sure?

302
00:26:58,856 --> 00:27:00,790
It's controlled by the Hutts.

303
00:27:00,891 --> 00:27:03,724
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

304
00:27:03,828 --> 00:27:06,221
- If they discovered her...
- It'd be no different than if we landed...

305
00:27:06,231 --> 00:27:08,131
on a system controlled
by the Federation,

306
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:12,568
except that the Hutts aren't looking
for her, which gives us the advantage.

307
00:27:17,076 --> 00:27:20,069
And Queen Amidala,
has she signed the treaty?

308
00:27:20,214 --> 00:27:23,843
She has disappeared, my lord.

309
00:27:23,951 --> 00:27:28,150
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

310
00:27:28,256 --> 00:27:31,191
I want that treaty signed.

311
00:27:31,292 --> 00:27:33,317
My lord,

312
00:27:33,428 --> 00:27:36,023
it's impossible
to locate the ship.

313
00:27:36,132 --> 00:27:38,327
It's out of our range.

314
00:27:38,434 --> 00:27:41,198
Not for a Sith.

315
00:27:41,303 --> 00:27:43,204
This is my apprentice,

316
00:27:43,306 --> 00:27:45,206
Darth Maul.

317
00:27:46,543 --> 00:27:49,842
He will find your lost ship.

318
00:27:54,218 --> 00:27:56,516
This is getting out of hand.

319
00:27:56,621 --> 00:27:58,681
Now there are two of them.

320
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:01,817
We should not
have made this bargain.

321
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:10,628
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

322
00:28:10,737 --> 00:28:13,638
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

323
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,074
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

324
00:28:19,747 --> 00:28:21,875
R2-D2, Your Highness.

325
00:28:22,017 --> 00:28:27,114
Thank you, R2-D2.

326
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:30,089
Padme.

327
00:28:30,193 --> 00:28:32,354
Clean this droid up
as best you can.

328
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:34,430
It deserves our gratitude.

329
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:38,725
Continue, Captain.

330
00:28:39,837 --> 00:28:42,237
Your Highness,
with your permission,

331
00:28:42,339 --> 00:28:45,400
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

332
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,877
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

333
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,608
I do not agree
with the Jedi on this.

334
00:28:51,716 --> 00:28:54,618
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

335
00:28:58,057 --> 00:28:59,786
Hello.

336
00:28:59,892 --> 00:29:02,862
Sorry.
Husa are yousa?

337
00:29:02,996 --> 00:29:05,464
I'm Padme.

338
00:29:05,565 --> 00:29:08,592
Mesa JarJar Binks.

339
00:29:08,703 --> 00:29:10,728
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

340
00:29:10,838 --> 00:29:12,863
Uh-huh.

341
00:29:12,974 --> 00:29:16,570
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

342
00:29:16,678 --> 00:29:20,375
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen.

343
00:29:20,482 --> 00:29:23,280
Den boom!
Getten berry scared...

344
00:29:23,385 --> 00:29:26,787
and grabben dat Jedi,
and pow... mesa here.

345
00:29:26,923 --> 00:29:29,585
Huh. Mesa getten berry, berry scared.

346
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,998
- That's it... Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

347
00:29:40,105 --> 00:29:44,201
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

348
00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:04,260
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

349
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,867
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.

350
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:10,129
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

351
00:30:10,238 --> 00:30:13,072
Don't let them send
any transmissions.

352
00:30:18,347 --> 00:30:20,782
This sun doen murder
to mesa skin.

353
00:30:20,884 --> 00:30:23,375
Wait!

354
00:30:23,486 --> 00:30:25,386
Wait.

355
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,193
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

356
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:35,130
No more commands from
Her Highness today, Captain.

357
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:37,326
The spaceport is not
going to be pleasant.

358
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,562
The queen wishes it.

359
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:41,639
She's curious
about the planet.

360
00:30:42,742 --> 00:30:45,267
This is not a good idea.

361
00:30:45,378 --> 00:30:47,278
Stay close to me.

362
00:31:01,062 --> 00:31:03,895
Moisture farms,
for the most part.

363
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:08,898
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.

364
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:13,373
The few spaceports like this one are havens
for those that don't wish to be found.

365
00:31:13,477 --> 00:31:15,377
Like us.

366
00:31:16,713 --> 00:31:19,307
Dissen berry berry bad.

367
00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:22,614
Oh! Icky icky goo!

368
00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:38,833
We'll try one
of the smaller dealers.

369
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:47,144
Good day to you.

370
00:31:47,248 --> 00:31:49,011
What do you want?

371
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,846
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

372
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:56,015
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

373
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:58,592
Boy, get in here now!

374
00:31:58,694 --> 00:32:02,927
My droid has a readout of what I need.

375
00:32:03,032 --> 00:32:04,932
What took you so long?

376
00:32:05,034 --> 00:32:07,298
I was cleaning the fan switches.

377
00:32:07,403 --> 00:32:09,634
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

378
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:13,403
So... let me take thee
out back, huh?

379
00:32:13,544 --> 00:32:17,413
Ni you'll find what you need.

380
00:32:17,515 --> 00:32:19,881
- Hmm?
- Don't touch anything.

381
00:32:19,985 --> 00:32:21,885
Hmph!

382
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:29,059
Hmm.

383
00:32:29,161 --> 00:32:32,859
- Are you an angel?
- What?

384
00:32:32,966 --> 00:32:36,697
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

385
00:32:36,803 --> 00:32:39,705
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.

386
00:32:39,807 --> 00:32:42,367
They live on the moons
of lego, I think.

387
00:32:42,477 --> 00:32:44,843
You're a funny little boy.

388
00:32:44,946 --> 00:32:46,847
How do you know so much?

389
00:32:46,949 --> 00:32:50,851
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

390
00:32:50,953 --> 00:32:55,288
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

391
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:59,351
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

392
00:32:59,462 --> 00:33:01,794
How long have you been here?

393
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:05,858
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

394
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,700
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt,

395
00:33:08,806 --> 00:33:11,537
but she lost us betting
on the Podraces.

396
00:33:11,643 --> 00:33:13,474
You're a slave?

397
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:17,743
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

398
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:21,581
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

399
00:33:21,721 --> 00:33:24,417
Hmm. Hmm.

400
00:33:24,557 --> 00:33:27,994
Where... Wheres
yousa goin?

401
00:33:28,095 --> 00:33:30,427
Ugh!

402
00:33:32,566 --> 00:33:35,593
- I got ya.
- Hey!

403
00:33:35,703 --> 00:33:37,466
- What?
- Hit the nose.

404
00:33:37,572 --> 00:33:40,063
Oh! Uh.

405
00:33:42,111 --> 00:33:45,672
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

406
00:33:45,781 --> 00:33:48,409
I'm the only one
hereabouts who has one.

407
00:33:48,517 --> 00:33:52,045
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, huh?

408
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:55,090
Saying of which,

409
00:33:55,225 --> 00:33:57,626
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?

410
00:33:57,728 --> 00:33:59,787
I have 20,000
Republic dataries.

411
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:01,762
Republic credits?

412
00:34:01,866 --> 00:34:04,836
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

413
00:34:04,937 --> 00:34:08,065
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

414
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:11,802
- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.

415
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,742
No, they won't!

416
00:34:13,847 --> 00:34:18,045
What, you think you're some kind of
Jedi, waving your hand around like that?

417
00:34:18,151 --> 00:34:22,418
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

418
00:34:22,523 --> 00:34:26,653
No money, no parts, no deal.

419
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,289
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

420
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:41,938
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways if
I wasn't so good at building things.

421
00:34:42,044 --> 00:34:44,605
Oh! Aw! Ooh! Uh!

422
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:48,207
- Ai, ai! Whoa, ai!
- We're leaving. JarJar.

423
00:34:48,318 --> 00:34:50,582
Whaaa!

424
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:53,248
I'm glad to have
met you, Anakin.

425
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:55,189
I was glad to meet you too.

426
00:34:57,328 --> 00:35:00,321
What? Wha... Oh.

427
00:35:03,836 --> 00:35:08,171
Outlanders. They think we know nothing.

428
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:10,209
They seemed nice to me.

429
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,244
Clean the racks.

430
00:35:12,345 --> 00:35:13,573
Then you can go home.

431
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,615
Yippee!

432
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:24,057
And you're sure
there's nothing left on board?

433
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:26,059
A few containers of supplies.

434
00:35:26,161 --> 00:35:29,221
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with,

435
00:35:29,331 --> 00:35:31,664
not in the amount
you're talking about.

436
00:35:31,768 --> 00:35:34,202
All right. I'm sure another solution
will present itself.

437
00:35:34,337 --> 00:35:36,237
I'll check back later.

438
00:35:36,339 --> 00:35:38,706
Noah gain!
Noah gain.

439
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:41,676
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

440
00:35:41,779 --> 00:35:44,247
Wesa be wobbed un crunched!

441
00:35:44,381 --> 00:35:47,545
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

442
00:35:55,928 --> 00:35:59,364
Hmm?
Ah, mooie-mooie.

443
00:36:00,766 --> 00:36:04,203
Hey, hey!
Are you going to pay for that?

444
00:36:04,304 --> 00:36:06,101
Huh? Wanga?

445
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:08,071
It costs seven wupiupi.

446
00:36:11,246 --> 00:36:13,271
Ah! Chubaa...

447
00:36:13,414 --> 00:36:15,746
Oops.

448
00:36:18,721 --> 00:36:21,212
Is this yours?

449
00:36:21,323 --> 00:36:22,984
Who, mesa?

450
00:36:25,028 --> 00:36:27,019
Ouch! Ouch!

451
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:29,257
Careful, Sebulba.

452
00:36:29,366 --> 00:36:31,527
He's a big-time outlander.

453
00:36:31,635 --> 00:36:35,072
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

454
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:38,335
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

455
00:36:38,442 --> 00:36:42,243
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

456
00:36:42,381 --> 00:36:45,373
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

457
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:50,082
- Hi.
- Hi there.

458
00:36:50,189 --> 00:36:53,022
Your buddy here was about
to be turned into orange goo.

459
00:36:53,126 --> 00:36:56,619
He picked a fight with a Dug, an
especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba.

460
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:00,325
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

461
00:37:00,434 --> 00:37:04,428
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

462
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:06,439
Thanks, my young friend.

463
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:08,600
But... But...

464
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:12,044
But mesa doen nutten!

465
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:21,716
This storm
will slow them down.

466
00:37:21,858 --> 00:37:24,588
Looks pretty bad.

467
00:37:24,695 --> 00:37:27,256
- Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home.

468
00:37:27,365 --> 00:37:29,560
We'll be right there.

469
00:37:35,507 --> 00:37:37,668
Here, you'll like these pallies.

470
00:37:37,776 --> 00:37:40,370
- Here.
- Thank you.

471
00:37:41,547 --> 00:37:43,846
Oh, my bones are aching.

472
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:48,512
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

473
00:37:48,655 --> 00:37:51,523
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

474
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:54,219
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

475
00:37:54,362 --> 00:37:56,762
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.

476
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:00,733
Sandstorms are very,
very dangerous.

477
00:38:00,836 --> 00:38:03,327
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

478
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,220
Mom!

479
00:38:19,323 --> 00:38:23,055
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ahh, dissen cozy.

480
00:38:23,194 --> 00:38:25,594
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

481
00:38:25,697 --> 00:38:29,225
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

482
00:38:29,368 --> 00:38:31,768
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

483
00:38:31,871 --> 00:38:35,329
- Come on. I'll show you 3PO.
- Oh, mooie-mooie.

484
00:38:43,016 --> 00:38:46,282
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

485
00:38:46,387 --> 00:38:48,287
He's wonderful.

486
00:38:48,389 --> 00:38:51,256
You really like him?

487
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,295
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

488
00:38:55,798 --> 00:39:00,064
Oh. Oh. Uh...
Where is everybody?

489
00:39:00,169 --> 00:39:03,469
Whoops. Yeah.

490
00:39:03,573 --> 00:39:05,734
Oh, hello.

491
00:39:05,842 --> 00:39:09,176
I am C-3 PO,
human-cyborg relations.

492
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,180
How might I serve you?

493
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:14,046
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

494
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:17,713
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

495
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:21,657
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.

496
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,958
Oh, hello. I don't believe we
have been introduced.

497
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:29,130
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.

498
00:39:29,268 --> 00:39:32,295
I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

499
00:39:34,975 --> 00:39:38,172
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

500
00:39:39,848 --> 00:39:43,113
My parts are showing?
My goodness! Oh!

501
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:50,158
The death toll
is catastrophic.

502
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:52,659
We must bow to their wishes.

503
00:39:52,761 --> 00:39:54,821
You must contact me.

504
00:39:54,931 --> 00:39:57,627
It's a trick.
Send no reply.

505
00:39:57,734 --> 00:40:01,261
Send no transmissions
of any kind.

506
00:40:01,404 --> 00:40:04,932
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

507
00:40:05,076 --> 00:40:09,012
What if it is true,
and the people are dying?

508
00:40:09,146 --> 00:40:11,615
Either way,
we're running out of time.

509
00:40:25,231 --> 00:40:27,393
Tatooine is
sparsely populated.

510
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:30,299
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

511
00:40:30,404 --> 00:40:32,304
Move against the Jedi first.

512
00:40:32,406 --> 00:40:35,137
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

513
00:40:35,277 --> 00:40:37,177
to sign the treaty.

514
00:40:37,279 --> 00:40:39,440
At last we will reveal
ourselves to the Jedi.

515
00:40:39,581 --> 00:40:42,016
At last we will have revenge.

516
00:40:42,118 --> 00:40:45,019
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

517
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:47,521
They will be
no match for you.

518
00:40:52,362 --> 00:40:57,323
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

519
00:40:57,435 --> 00:41:00,461
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

520
00:41:00,572 --> 00:41:04,064
- Any attempt to escape...
- And they blow you up!

521
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:06,610
- Boom!
- How wude!

522
00:41:06,712 --> 00:41:09,146
I can't believe there's
still slavery in the galaxy.

523
00:41:09,281 --> 00:41:11,181
The Republic's
antislavery laws...

524
00:41:11,283 --> 00:41:13,616
The Republic
doesn't exist out here.

525
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,746
We must survive on our own.

526
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:19,518
Xcuse me.

527
00:41:19,626 --> 00:41:23,063
Has anybody ever seen
a Podrace?

528
00:41:23,164 --> 00:41:27,760
They have Podracing on Malastare.
Very fast, very dangerous.

529
00:41:27,868 --> 00:41:30,429
I'm the only human
who can do it.

530
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:33,702
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

531
00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:36,074
Don't do that again.

532
00:41:41,551 --> 00:41:44,112
You're a Jedi knight,
aren't you?

533
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:48,658
What makes you think that?

534
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:53,026
I saw your laser sword.
Only Jedis carry that kind of weapon.

535
00:41:53,131 --> 00:41:56,032
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

536
00:41:56,134 --> 00:41:58,034
I don't think so.

537
00:41:58,103 --> 00:42:00,265
No one can kill a Jedi.

538
00:42:00,373 --> 00:42:03,171
I wish that were so.

539
00:42:03,275 --> 00:42:05,334
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

540
00:42:05,444 --> 00:42:08,608
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

541
00:42:08,715 --> 00:42:12,082
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

542
00:42:12,185 --> 00:42:16,520
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

543
00:42:21,429 --> 00:42:24,194
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.

544
00:42:24,299 --> 00:42:27,325
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic,

545
00:42:27,436 --> 00:42:29,461
on a very important mission.

546
00:42:29,571 --> 00:42:32,598
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

547
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:36,338
Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded
here until we can repair it.

548
00:42:36,446 --> 00:42:38,574
I can help.

549
00:42:38,683 --> 00:42:42,449
- I can fix anything.
- I believe you can.

550
00:42:42,553 --> 00:42:45,386
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

551
00:42:45,489 --> 00:42:48,220
Wit no-nutten mula
to trade.

552
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,852
These junk dealers must have
a weakness of some kind.

553
00:42:51,997 --> 00:42:56,435
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

554
00:42:56,569 --> 00:43:00,767
Podracing.
Greed can be a powerful ally.

555
00:43:00,873 --> 00:43:03,741
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

556
00:43:03,844 --> 00:43:06,335
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

557
00:43:06,447 --> 00:43:09,041
- You could enter my pod.
- Anakin!

558
00:43:09,149 --> 00:43:12,210
- Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

559
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,220
You could make him think
it was yours...

560
00:43:14,322 --> 00:43:16,586
and get him to let me
pilot it for you.

561
00:43:16,691 --> 00:43:20,890
I don't want you to race. It's awful.
I die every time Watto makes you do it.

562
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:23,157
But, Mom, I love it.

563
00:43:23,299 --> 00:43:26,827
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

564
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:29,268
Anakin.

565
00:43:29,372 --> 00:43:32,170
Your mother's right.

566
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:35,370
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

567
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:38,546
No.

568
00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:48,219
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

569
00:43:52,232 --> 00:43:55,963
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

570
00:43:56,102 --> 00:43:58,003
We'll find some other way.

571
00:43:58,105 --> 00:44:00,369
No.

572
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:02,942
There is no other way.

573
00:44:03,043 --> 00:44:07,413
I may not like it,
but he can help you.

574
00:44:07,516 --> 00:44:10,076
He was meant to help you.

575
00:44:23,667 --> 00:44:25,567
Are you sure about this?

576
00:44:25,669 --> 00:44:28,332
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

577
00:44:28,473 --> 00:44:30,464
The queen will not approve.

578
00:44:30,608 --> 00:44:33,543
The queen
doesn't need to know.

579
00:44:33,645 --> 00:44:35,238
Well, I don't approve.

580
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:39,044
The boy tells me you want to
sponsor him in the race.

581
00:44:39,151 --> 00:44:44,180
How can you do this? Not on
the Republic credits, I think, huh?

582
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:46,452
My ship will be
the entry fee.

583
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,653
Oh, not bad!

584
00:44:48,762 --> 00:44:51,755
Not bad, huh?
A Nubian, huh?

585
00:44:51,866 --> 00:44:55,165
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

586
00:44:55,269 --> 00:44:57,794
What would the boy ride?

587
00:44:57,905 --> 00:45:01,467
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It will take some long time to fix it.

588
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:05,706
It wasn't my fault, really.
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

589
00:45:05,848 --> 00:45:09,216
I actually saved the pod,
mostly.

590
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:12,777
Mmm. That you did, huh.

591
00:45:12,922 --> 00:45:15,756
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

592
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:20,160
I have acquired a pod in a game
of chance, the fastest ever built.

593
00:45:20,264 --> 00:45:25,396
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

594
00:45:27,372 --> 00:45:30,433
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee,

595
00:45:30,543 --> 00:45:32,443
and I supply the boy.

596
00:45:32,545 --> 00:45:36,447
We split the winnings,
um, 50-50, I think, huh?

597
00:45:36,582 --> 00:45:41,179
If it's going to be 50-50, I suggest
you front the cash for the entry.

598
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,346
If we win,

599
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:47,291
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

600
00:45:47,395 --> 00:45:50,626
And if we lose,
you keep my ship.

601
00:45:51,933 --> 00:45:54,459
Either way, you win.

602
00:46:00,276 --> 00:46:02,609
Deal!

603
00:46:06,783 --> 00:46:11,483
Your friend is a foolish one, me thinks.

604
00:46:19,031 --> 00:46:21,966
What if this plan fails,
Master?

605
00:46:22,067 --> 00:46:24,832
We could be stuck here
a very long time.

606
00:46:24,938 --> 00:46:27,429
Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help,

607
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,976
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

608
00:46:31,077 --> 00:46:33,046
And...

609
00:46:33,147 --> 00:46:35,980
there's something
about this boy.

610
00:46:41,156 --> 00:46:44,182
You should be very proud
of your son.

611
00:46:44,326 --> 00:46:47,318
He gives without
any thought of reward.

612
00:46:47,463 --> 00:46:50,330
Well, he knows
nothing of greed.

613
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:54,369
- He has a...
- He has special powers.

614
00:46:55,539 --> 00:46:57,439
Yes.

615
00:46:57,541 --> 00:47:00,135
He can see things
before they happen.

616
00:47:00,243 --> 00:47:03,077
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

617
00:47:03,181 --> 00:47:05,081
It's a Jedi trait.

618
00:47:05,183 --> 00:47:08,016
- He deserves better than a slave's life.
- Why, certainly.

619
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:11,487
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

620
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:16,493
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

621
00:47:17,663 --> 00:47:19,564
Who was his father?

622
00:47:22,268 --> 00:47:24,202
There was no father.

623
00:47:25,638 --> 00:47:29,006
I carried him, I gave birth,
I raised him.

624
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:32,341
I can't explain
what happened.

625
00:47:34,015 --> 00:47:35,813
Can you help him?

626
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:37,817
I don't know.

627
00:47:40,322 --> 00:47:43,918
I didn't actually
come here to free slaves.

628
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:53,068
Hey, hi, Ani.

629
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,695
Hi.

630
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,003
Wow, a real astro droid.

631
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:04,679
- How did you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

632
00:48:04,783 --> 00:48:07,719
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

633
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,549
With this?

634
00:48:09,655 --> 00:48:12,453
You're such a joker, Ani.

635
00:48:12,558 --> 00:48:15,790
- You've been working on that thing for years.
- It's never gonna run.

636
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:18,091
Come on.
Let's go and play ball.

637
00:48:18,198 --> 00:48:21,464
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

638
00:48:28,042 --> 00:48:29,943
Hey, JarJar.

639
00:48:30,045 --> 00:48:32,445
Keep away from those energy binders.

640
00:48:32,548 --> 00:48:36,006
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

641
00:48:36,118 --> 00:48:38,144
Sorry. Okay.

642
00:48:41,591 --> 00:48:43,752
My tongue is fat.

643
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:46,989
My tongue...
Wrench.

644
00:48:47,098 --> 00:48:49,760
Where is da wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

645
00:48:49,867 --> 00:48:52,462
Hey. Uh-oh.

646
00:48:52,571 --> 00:48:55,768
Uh, Ani, I'm stuck.
Ani...

647
00:48:55,907 --> 00:48:59,901
You know, I find that JarJar creature
to be a little odd.

648
00:49:01,781 --> 00:49:04,614
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

649
00:49:04,717 --> 00:49:06,810
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

650
00:49:06,919 --> 00:49:09,150
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

651
00:49:09,256 --> 00:49:11,349
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

652
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:13,619
My... My mouth.

653
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:17,323
Ani, I'm stuck.

654
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:22,494
Uh, hey.
My tongue is fat. Ani!

655
00:49:22,604 --> 00:49:25,540
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

656
00:49:26,642 --> 00:49:29,338
Oh. Th... Thank you.

657
00:49:29,478 --> 00:49:31,379
Go.

658
00:49:45,863 --> 00:49:49,493
It's working!
It's working!

659
00:50:00,113 --> 00:50:02,639
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

660
00:50:02,783 --> 00:50:06,719
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

661
00:50:06,854 --> 00:50:08,719
Most of them.

662
00:50:08,822 --> 00:50:10,791
Has anyone been to 'em all?

663
00:50:10,926 --> 00:50:13,724
Not likely.

664
00:50:13,828 --> 00:50:16,888
I wanna be the first one
to see 'em all.

665
00:50:18,234 --> 00:50:20,634
- Ani, bedtime!
- Ow!

666
00:50:20,736 --> 00:50:23,500
There we are.
Good as new.

667
00:50:23,606 --> 00:50:26,508
Ani, I'm not gonna
tell you again.

668
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:30,068
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

669
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,810
Go on. You have
a big day tomorrow.

670
00:50:33,918 --> 00:50:35,818
Sleep well, Ani.

671
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:40,590
- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?

672
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,100
I need an analysis of this blood sample
I'm sending you.

673
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,000
Wait a minute.

674
00:50:46,532 --> 00:50:48,332
I need
a midi-chlorian count.

675
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,700
The reading is off the chart.

676
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,100
Over 20,000.

677
00:50:56,209 --> 00:50:59,709
Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.

678
00:50:59,747 --> 00:51:01,578
No Jedi has.

679
00:51:01,682 --> 00:51:03,741
What does that mean?

680
00:51:03,851 --> 00:51:05,752
I'm not sure.

681
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:19,102
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

682
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:22,935
Patience, my blue friend. You'll have
your winnings before the suns set.

683
00:52:23,041 --> 00:52:25,271
And we'll be far away
from here.

684
00:52:25,377 --> 00:52:28,938
Not if your ship belongs
to me, I think, huh?

685
00:52:29,047 --> 00:52:32,916
I warn you, no funny business.

686
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:36,147
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrong, no.

687
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:38,758
I have great faith
in the boy.

688
00:52:38,892 --> 00:52:40,985
He's a credit to your race,

689
00:52:41,128 --> 00:52:44,359
but, uh, Sebulba there
is going to win, I think.

690
00:52:46,468 --> 00:52:48,231
Oh, no!

691
00:52:52,374 --> 00:52:54,240
Why do you think that?

692
00:52:54,343 --> 00:52:58,143
He always wins!

693
00:52:58,247 --> 00:53:00,681
I am betting heavily
on Sebulba.

694
00:53:02,519 --> 00:53:05,852
- I'll take that bet.
- You what?

695
00:53:05,956 --> 00:53:09,324
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say,

696
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:11,360
the boy and his mother.

697
00:53:11,462 --> 00:53:15,159
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

698
00:53:15,266 --> 00:53:17,827
The boy, then.

699
00:53:17,936 --> 00:53:20,632
Hmm. Well, uh...

700
00:53:24,042 --> 00:53:26,568
We'll let fate decide, huh?

701
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:30,115
I just happen to have
a chance cube here.

702
00:53:30,216 --> 00:53:33,277
Blue, it's the boy.

703
00:53:33,387 --> 00:53:37,585
Red, uh... his mother.

704
00:53:47,269 --> 00:53:51,969
You won this small toss, outlander,
but you won't win the race!

705
00:53:52,074 --> 00:53:54,167
So it makes
little difference!

706
00:54:03,988 --> 00:54:06,582
Better stop your friend's betting,

707
00:54:06,691 --> 00:54:10,286
or I'll end up owning him too.

708
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:15,122
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

709
00:54:15,267 --> 00:54:17,292
Good morning.

710
00:54:17,436 --> 00:54:19,405
Oh, my.

711
00:54:19,539 --> 00:54:21,507
Space travel sounds
rather perilous.

712
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:27,638
I can assure you, they will never get
me onto one of those dreadful starships.

713
00:54:27,748 --> 00:54:31,149
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

714
00:54:31,252 --> 00:54:35,519
- Do what?
- Finish the race, of course.

715
00:54:35,624 --> 00:54:40,220
- You've never won a race?
- Well, not exactly.

716
00:54:40,329 --> 00:54:42,354
Not even finished?

717
00:54:42,465 --> 00:54:44,956
Kitster's right.
I will this time.

718
00:54:45,068 --> 00:54:47,059
Of course you will.

719
00:55:14,535 --> 00:55:16,628
...Podracers.

720
00:55:16,737 --> 00:55:18,602
That's absolutely right.

721
00:55:18,705 --> 00:55:23,734
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

722
00:55:23,878 --> 00:55:27,473
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

723
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:32,451
I see Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund System.

724
00:55:38,128 --> 00:55:40,596
Two-time winner Boles Roor.

725
00:55:43,099 --> 00:55:45,762
Sebulba!

726
00:55:55,347 --> 00:55:58,407
And in the front row,
nearside pole position,

727
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:00,542
Mawhonic!

728
00:56:01,788 --> 00:56:03,779
A hearty hello...

729
00:56:03,923 --> 00:56:07,654
to Clegg Holdfast
and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!

730
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,525
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

731
00:56:10,631 --> 00:56:13,657
And back again,
it's the mighty Dud Bolt...

732
00:56:13,767 --> 00:56:18,364
with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.

733
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:24,009
And hoping for a big win today,

734
00:56:24,113 --> 00:56:28,516
Ody Mandrell, with his
record-setting pit droid team.

735
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:36,688
And a late entry,
young Anakin Skywalker,

736
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:39,285
A local boy.

737
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:43,062
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

738
00:56:53,145 --> 00:56:55,580
Huh?

739
00:56:58,184 --> 00:57:00,175
Pee yousa!

740
00:57:02,923 --> 00:57:04,823
Be safe.

741
00:57:04,925 --> 00:57:08,326
I will, Mom.
I promise.

742
00:57:17,939 --> 00:57:20,670
Uh-oh.

743
00:57:23,379 --> 00:57:26,178
You won't walk away from this one,

744
00:57:26,283 --> 00:57:28,547
you slave scum.

745
00:57:28,652 --> 00:57:31,883
Don't count on it, slime ball.

746
00:57:31,989 --> 00:57:34,151
You're bantha fodder!

747
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:41,160
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

748
00:57:41,266 --> 00:57:43,167
- Right.
- Whoa!

749
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:49,666
Remember, concentrate
on the moment.

750
00:57:49,776 --> 00:57:53,542
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.

751
00:57:53,647 --> 00:57:55,308
I will.

752
00:57:55,415 --> 00:57:57,611
May the Force be with you.

753
00:58:06,562 --> 00:58:09,554
Jabba the Hutt.

754
00:58:12,034 --> 00:58:14,503
Mmm.

755
00:58:18,608 --> 00:58:22,306
Welcome.

756
00:58:24,348 --> 00:58:27,442
Begin the race!

757
00:58:37,997 --> 00:58:41,125
Hey, it looks like
they're clearing the grid.

758
00:58:42,368 --> 00:58:44,269
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

759
00:58:45,873 --> 00:58:48,774
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not...

760
00:58:48,876 --> 00:58:51,778
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

761
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,780
You should too.

762
00:58:53,882 --> 00:58:56,316
You assume too much.

763
00:58:56,417 --> 00:58:59,478
Start your engines.

764
00:59:38,766 --> 00:59:42,133
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

765
00:59:52,147 --> 00:59:54,013
Oh!

766
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:04,787
Oh, no! No!

767
01:00:09,066 --> 01:00:12,366
Wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.

768
01:00:22,815 --> 01:00:27,048
Well, it looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.

769
01:00:28,622 --> 01:00:31,090
Come on, Ani!

770
01:00:36,364 --> 01:00:39,527
- And there goes Skywalker!
- Go, Ani, go!

771
01:00:39,634 --> 01:00:41,762
He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.

772
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:47,536
Ehh!

773
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,880
Haaaa!

774
01:01:55,419 --> 01:02:00,187
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out on the canyon dune turn.

775
01:02:07,133 --> 01:02:10,125
Doowat macroon!

776
01:02:12,472 --> 01:02:16,170
Ooh, there goes
Quadinaros' power coupling.

777
01:02:17,878 --> 01:02:19,778
Cheespa wata!

778
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,472
Ooh!

779
01:02:21,582 --> 01:02:25,485
Chubba ni chees Sebulba!
Paketa!

780
01:02:25,587 --> 01:02:27,282
Kulkah meeka!

781
01:02:27,522 --> 01:02:32,017
Ody Mandrell coona wa wunda dungo!

782
01:02:38,902 --> 01:02:40,369
Whoa!

783
01:02:43,907 --> 01:02:46,138
Oh, no!

784
01:02:46,244 --> 01:02:49,042
Oh.

785
01:02:50,915 --> 01:02:54,010
Where is Master Anakin?

786
01:02:56,021 --> 01:02:58,251
Look.
Here he comes.

787
01:03:00,592 --> 01:03:03,494
It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.

788
01:03:03,596 --> 01:03:05,723
Yay!
Yippee!

789
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:14,808
He has to complete two more circuits?

790
01:03:14,942 --> 01:03:16,843
Oh, dear.

791
01:04:07,502 --> 01:04:09,094
Ah.

792
01:04:09,203 --> 01:04:11,536
Ha!

793
01:04:14,042 --> 01:04:16,977
Arrr!

794
01:04:24,454 --> 01:04:26,319
Skywalker's spinning
out of control!

795
01:05:24,288 --> 01:05:28,224
Oh, I don't care what universe
you're from. That's gotta hurt!

796
01:05:35,267 --> 01:05:37,031
Here he comes!
Owoo!

797
01:05:37,136 --> 01:05:40,264
At the start of
the final lap, Sebulba's in the lead,

798
01:05:40,373 --> 01:05:42,864
followed closely by Skywalker!

799
01:05:42,976 --> 01:05:45,946
Go, Ani!

800
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,800
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

801
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,600
Whoa-oa!

802
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,200
Huh?

803
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,863
- It's Skywalker!
- Sebulba!

804
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,301
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

805
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,100
Did he crash-ed?

806
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,100
Wah hota!

807
01:07:25,826 --> 01:07:29,023
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

808
01:08:22,022 --> 01:08:24,718
- He's catching Sebulba!
- Inkabunga!

809
01:08:24,825 --> 01:08:27,350
Careful, Ani.
Careful, Ani!

810
01:08:28,696 --> 01:08:30,789
Wha...
Chuba da noya!

811
01:08:57,695 --> 01:09:01,097
- That little human being is out of his mind.
- Punda tah punda!

812
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,760
- They're side by side!
- Bangu du bangu!

813
01:09:11,044 --> 01:09:13,035
Wa-waaaaah!

814
01:09:20,588 --> 01:09:22,489
Aaah!

815
01:09:23,725 --> 01:09:25,625
Poo doo!

816
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:32,933
- Yippee!
- Yay!

817
01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:35,629
Ya eeka buta!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

818
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:38,867
I can't believe it.

819
01:09:38,976 --> 01:09:40,876
The crowds are going nuts!

820
01:09:40,978 --> 01:09:43,105
Oh! Ah!
Oh! Ah!

821
01:09:45,282 --> 01:09:49,652
Ooh! Ah! Ooh! Ah! Ooh! Ah! Ooh! Ah!

822
01:09:49,787 --> 01:09:51,812
Yay, Ani!

823
01:09:53,191 --> 01:09:56,184
Mom, I did it!
Yeah!

824
01:10:03,737 --> 01:10:05,637
Ohh!

825
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:08,640
Good going, Ani!

826
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:14,971
We owe you everything, Ani.

827
01:10:15,082 --> 01:10:17,483
- Mmm!
- Aww.

828
01:10:17,586 --> 01:10:19,679
It's so wonderful, Ani.

829
01:10:19,788 --> 01:10:22,518
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

830
01:10:22,658 --> 01:10:24,854
I'm so very proud of you.

831
01:10:26,996 --> 01:10:28,896
Aww.

832
01:10:28,998 --> 01:10:31,398
Oy chuba no.

833
01:10:35,339 --> 01:10:37,239
You.

834
01:10:37,341 --> 01:10:39,673
You swindled me!

835
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:43,612
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehow you knew it.

836
01:10:43,715 --> 01:10:45,615
I lost everything.

837
01:10:45,717 --> 01:10:48,619
Whenever you gamble, my friend,
eventually you'll lose.

838
01:10:48,721 --> 01:10:51,588
Bring the parts
to the main hangar.

839
01:10:51,691 --> 01:10:55,024
I'll come by your shop later on
so you can release the boy.

840
01:10:55,161 --> 01:10:58,427
You can't have him.
It wasn't a fair bet.

841
01:11:01,234 --> 01:11:04,136
Would you like to discuss
it with the Hutts?

842
01:11:04,238 --> 01:11:06,297
I'm sure
they can settle this.

843
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:10,710
Take him.

844
01:11:17,653 --> 01:11:19,554
Hidoe!

845
01:11:19,656 --> 01:11:22,557
Well, we have all
the essential parts we need.

846
01:11:22,659 --> 01:11:25,753
I'm going back. Some unfinished
business. I won't be long.

847
01:11:25,862 --> 01:11:29,355
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

848
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:33,334
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

849
01:11:33,437 --> 01:11:35,338
Get this hyperdrive
generator installed.

850
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,000
Yes, Master.
That shouldn't take long.

851
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:40,271
Come on. Hup!

852
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:48,012
Hey.
These are yours.

853
01:11:48,121 --> 01:11:50,021
Yes!

854
01:11:51,558 --> 01:11:53,458
Mom, we sold the pod!

855
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,960
- Look at all the money we have!
- My goodness!

856
01:11:56,063 --> 01:11:58,931
- But that's so wonderful, Ani.
- And he has been freed.

857
01:11:59,034 --> 01:12:01,798
- What?
- You're no longer a slave.

858
01:12:03,738 --> 01:12:05,672
Did you hear that?

859
01:12:05,775 --> 01:12:08,938
Now you can make
your dreams come true, Ani.

860
01:12:09,045 --> 01:12:11,707
You are free.

861
01:12:14,885 --> 01:12:16,785
Will you take him with you?

862
01:12:16,887 --> 01:12:19,185
- Is he to become a Jedi?
- Yes.

863
01:12:19,289 --> 01:12:21,189
Our meeting
was not a coincidence.

864
01:12:21,291 --> 01:12:23,726
Nothing happens by accident.

865
01:12:23,828 --> 01:12:27,389
You mean I get to come with you
in your starship?

866
01:12:27,498 --> 01:12:29,399
Anakin,

867
01:12:30,803 --> 01:12:34,102
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge,

868
01:12:34,206 --> 01:12:37,142
and even if you succeed,
it's a hard life.

869
01:12:37,243 --> 01:12:40,371
But I wanna go.
It's what I've always dreamed of doing.

870
01:12:40,513 --> 01:12:43,380
Can I go, Mom?

871
01:12:43,483 --> 01:12:45,714
Anakin,

872
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:49,051
this path has been placed
before you.

873
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:51,647
The choice is yours alone.

874
01:12:55,297 --> 01:12:57,197
I wanna do it.

875
01:12:58,767 --> 01:13:00,998
Then pack your things.
We haven't much time.

876
01:13:01,104 --> 01:13:03,163
Yippee!

877
01:13:08,278 --> 01:13:10,178
What about Mom?

878
01:13:13,317 --> 01:13:15,217
Is she free too?

879
01:13:15,319 --> 01:13:18,847
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

880
01:13:18,957 --> 01:13:21,858
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Mom?

881
01:13:29,502 --> 01:13:33,200
Son, my place is here.
My future is here.

882
01:13:33,306 --> 01:13:36,707
It is time for you to let go.

883
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:38,937
I don't want things
to change.

884
01:13:39,045 --> 01:13:41,446
But you can't stop
the change...

885
01:13:41,582 --> 01:13:44,608
any more than you can
stop the suns from setting.

886
01:13:45,753 --> 01:13:47,654
Oh, I love you.

887
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:55,229
Now hurry.

888
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:02,170
Thank you.

889
01:14:02,272 --> 01:14:05,174
I'll watch after him.
You have my word.

890
01:14:07,178 --> 01:14:09,840
Will you be all right?

891
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,700
Yeah.

892
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,900
Oh!
Oh, my. Oh!

893
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,600
Hello, Master Anakin.

894
01:14:18,624 --> 01:14:20,683
Well, 3PO,
I've been freed...

895
01:14:20,827 --> 01:14:23,227
and I'm going away
in a starship.

896
01:14:23,329 --> 01:14:26,265
Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.

897
01:14:26,366 --> 01:14:30,598
However, I should prefer it if
I were a little more completed.

898
01:14:30,704 --> 01:14:36,041
I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you,
3 PO, give you coverings and all.

899
01:14:36,144 --> 01:14:40,103
I'm gonna miss working on you.
You've been a great pal.

900
01:14:40,215 --> 01:14:43,117
I'll make sure Mom doesn't
sell you or anything.

901
01:14:43,219 --> 01:14:44,948
Sell me?

902
01:14:45,054 --> 01:14:46,646
Bye.

903
01:14:46,755 --> 01:14:48,655
Oh, my.

904
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:15,052
I can't do it, Mom.
I just can't do it.

905
01:15:15,154 --> 01:15:17,816
Ani.

906
01:15:19,125 --> 01:15:21,321
Will I ever see you again?

907
01:15:22,796 --> 01:15:25,697
What does your heart
tell you?

908
01:15:27,034 --> 01:15:29,265
I hope so.

909
01:15:29,371 --> 01:15:31,271
Yes.

910
01:15:31,373 --> 01:15:33,273
I guess.

911
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:36,277
Then we will
see each other again.

912
01:15:39,315 --> 01:15:42,216
I will come back
and free you, Mom.

913
01:15:42,318 --> 01:15:44,253
I promise.

914
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:55,429
Now, be brave...

915
01:15:55,566 --> 01:15:58,228
and don't look back.

916
01:15:58,369 --> 01:16:00,270
Don't look back.

917
01:16:45,522 --> 01:16:48,492
- Qui-Gon, sir, wait! I'm tired!
- Anakin! Drop!

918
01:16:50,962 --> 01:16:53,864
Go!
Tell them to take off!

919
01:17:07,481 --> 01:17:09,381
Qui-Gon's
in trouble.

920
01:17:09,484 --> 01:17:11,179
Take off.

921
01:17:12,286 --> 01:17:14,049
Over there.
Fly low.

922
01:17:34,979 --> 01:17:36,879
Are you all right?

923
01:17:37,014 --> 01:17:38,914
I think so.

924
01:17:39,016 --> 01:17:40,917
What was it?

925
01:17:41,019 --> 01:17:44,420
I'm not sure, but it was
well-trained in the Jedi arts.

926
01:17:44,523 --> 01:17:47,515
My guess is it was after the queen.

927
01:17:47,626 --> 01:17:50,152
What are we gonna do
about it?

928
01:17:52,098 --> 01:17:53,998
We shall be patient.

929
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:56,899
Anakin Skywalker,
meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

930
01:17:57,004 --> 01:17:59,199
Hi.

931
01:17:59,306 --> 01:18:03,003
You're a Jedi too?
Pleased to meet you.

932
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:13,120
Your queen is lost,
your people are starving,

933
01:18:13,222 --> 01:18:15,122
and you, Governor,
are going to die...

934
01:18:15,224 --> 01:18:18,125
much sooner than your people,
I'm afraid.

935
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:20,389
This invasion
will gain you nothing.

936
01:18:20,497 --> 01:18:23,523
We're a democracy.
The people have decided.

937
01:18:23,633 --> 01:18:25,533
Take him away.

938
01:18:28,973 --> 01:18:31,874
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

939
01:18:31,976 --> 01:18:34,376
for these rumored
underwater villages.

940
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:36,880
They will not
stay hidden for long.

941
01:18:47,927 --> 01:18:50,658
The death toll
is catastrophic.

942
01:18:50,764 --> 01:18:53,392
We must bow to their wishes.

943
01:18:53,501 --> 01:18:55,731
You must contact me.

944
01:19:09,852 --> 01:19:11,786
You all right?

945
01:19:11,888 --> 01:19:14,517
It's very cold.

946
01:19:22,567 --> 01:19:25,468
You come from
a warm planet, Ani.

947
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:27,970
A little too warm
for my taste.

948
01:19:28,072 --> 01:19:30,337
Space is cold.

949
01:19:30,442 --> 01:19:32,603
You seem sad.

950
01:19:33,746 --> 01:19:36,044
The queen is worried.

951
01:19:36,148 --> 01:19:38,583
Her people are suffering,
dying.

952
01:19:38,685 --> 01:19:42,177
She must convince the senate
to intervene, or...

953
01:19:43,657 --> 01:19:45,922
I'm not sure what'll happen.

954
01:19:47,361 --> 01:19:49,420
I made this for you...

955
01:19:50,932 --> 01:19:52,832
so you'd remember me.

956
01:19:52,935 --> 01:19:56,234
I carved it
out of a japor snippet.

957
01:19:56,338 --> 01:19:59,171
It'll bring you good fortune.

958
01:19:59,274 --> 01:20:01,175
It's beautiful.

959
01:20:01,277 --> 01:20:04,678
But I don't need this
to remember you by.

960
01:20:07,317 --> 01:20:10,719
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani,

961
01:20:10,821 --> 01:20:13,381
but my caring for you
will remain.

962
01:20:16,093 --> 01:20:19,222
I care for you, too,
only I...

963
01:20:19,331 --> 01:20:21,492
Miss your mother.

964
01:20:39,988 --> 01:20:44,186
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

965
01:20:44,292 --> 01:20:46,055
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

966
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:49,426
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

967
01:21:18,731 --> 01:21:21,962
It is a great gift to see you alive,
Your Majesty.

968
01:21:22,068 --> 01:21:24,901
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

969
01:21:25,004 --> 01:21:27,633
I'm anxious to hear your report
on the situation.

970
01:21:27,741 --> 01:21:30,369
May I present
Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

971
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:34,608
Welcome, Your Highness. It's an honor
to finally meet you in person.

972
01:21:34,749 --> 01:21:37,309
Thank you,
Supreme Chancellor.

973
01:21:37,452 --> 01:21:40,615
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

974
01:21:40,722 --> 01:21:44,454
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.

975
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,461
I'm grateful for your concern,
Chancellor.

976
01:21:47,563 --> 01:21:49,463
There is a question
of procedure,

977
01:21:49,565 --> 01:21:52,296
but I'm confident
we can overcome it.

978
01:21:52,402 --> 01:21:55,303
I must speak with
the Jedi Council immediately.

979
01:21:55,405 --> 01:21:58,204
The situation has become
much more complicated.

980
01:22:03,981 --> 01:22:05,882
Ani, come on.

981
01:22:16,429 --> 01:22:19,830
The queen's a bein' grossly nice,
mesa tinks.

982
01:22:21,168 --> 01:22:23,136
Pitty hot.

983
01:22:51,001 --> 01:22:55,336
There is no civility, only politics.

984
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:59,342
The Republic
is not what it once was.

985
01:22:59,444 --> 01:23:04,712
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

986
01:23:04,817 --> 01:23:06,682
There is no interest...

987
01:23:06,786 --> 01:23:08,880
in the common good.

988
01:23:08,989 --> 01:23:11,219
I must be frank,
Your Majesty.

989
01:23:11,358 --> 01:23:14,259
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.

990
01:23:14,361 --> 01:23:17,263
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

991
01:23:17,365 --> 01:23:21,461
If I may say so, Your Majesty,
the chancellor has little real power.

992
01:23:21,569 --> 01:23:25,472
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

993
01:23:25,574 --> 01:23:29,305
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

994
01:23:29,411 --> 01:23:32,973
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

995
01:23:33,082 --> 01:23:34,982
of a stronger
supreme chancellor,

996
01:23:35,084 --> 01:23:37,575
one who could control
the bureaucrats...

997
01:23:37,687 --> 01:23:39,519
and give us justice.

998
01:23:39,623 --> 01:23:43,889
You could call for
a vote of no confidence...

999
01:23:44,028 --> 01:23:45,928
in Chancellor Valorum.

1000
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:48,522
He has been
our strongest supporter.

1001
01:23:48,667 --> 01:23:53,900
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.

1002
01:23:54,005 --> 01:23:57,339
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.

1003
01:23:57,443 --> 01:24:00,344
Our people are dying,
Senator.

1004
01:24:00,446 --> 01:24:04,178
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

1005
01:24:04,284 --> 01:24:06,912
To be realistic,
Your Majesty,

1006
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:11,981
I think we're going to have to accept
Federation control for the time being.

1007
01:24:13,761 --> 01:24:15,820
That is something
I cannot do.

1008
01:24:23,205 --> 01:24:25,800
He was trained
in the Jedi arts.

1009
01:24:25,909 --> 01:24:29,845
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

1010
01:24:29,946 --> 01:24:34,145
Impossible. The Sith have been
extinct for a millennium.

1011
01:24:34,252 --> 01:24:38,450
I do not believe the Sith
could have returned without us knowing.

1012
01:24:38,556 --> 01:24:41,651
Ah, hard to see,
the dark side is.

1013
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,661
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

1014
01:24:44,763 --> 01:24:47,755
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

1015
01:24:47,866 --> 01:24:49,767
May the Force be with you.

1016
01:24:53,373 --> 01:24:55,307
Master Qui-Gon.

1017
01:24:55,408 --> 01:24:57,809
More to say have you?

1018
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,980
With your permission,
my master,

1019
01:25:03,484 --> 01:25:06,511
I have encountered
a vergence in the Force.

1020
01:25:07,622 --> 01:25:09,647
A vergence, you say?

1021
01:25:09,758 --> 01:25:11,885
Located around a person?

1022
01:25:11,993 --> 01:25:13,894
A boy.

1023
01:25:13,996 --> 01:25:17,830
His cells have the highest concentration of
midi-chlorians I have seen in a life-form.

1024
01:25:17,934 --> 01:25:20,802
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

1025
01:25:22,472 --> 01:25:24,838
You refer to the prophecy...

1026
01:25:24,975 --> 01:25:27,375
of the one who will bring
balance to the Force.

1027
01:25:27,477 --> 01:25:29,343
You believe it's this boy?

1028
01:25:29,447 --> 01:25:32,041
- I don't presume to...
- But you do.

1029
01:25:32,150 --> 01:25:34,778
Revealed your opinion is.

1030
01:25:34,886 --> 01:25:36,912
I request the boy
be tested, Master.

1031
01:25:37,022 --> 01:25:42,255
Oh? Trained as a Jedi
you request for him, hmm?

1032
01:25:42,361 --> 01:25:45,126
Finding him
was the will of the Force.

1033
01:25:45,231 --> 01:25:47,131
I have no doubt of that.

1034
01:25:53,307 --> 01:25:55,832
Bring him before us, then.

1035
01:26:05,954 --> 01:26:08,856
The boy's here to see Padme.

1036
01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:10,858
Let him in.

1037
01:26:13,763 --> 01:26:17,666
I'm sorry, Ani,
but Padme's not here right now.

1038
01:26:17,768 --> 01:26:20,100
Who is it?

1039
01:26:20,204 --> 01:26:23,231
Anakin Skywalker to see Padme,
Your Highness.

1040
01:26:23,341 --> 01:26:25,241
I've sent Padme on an errand.

1041
01:26:25,343 --> 01:26:30,213
I'm on my way to the Jedi temple
to start my training, I hope.

1042
01:26:30,349 --> 01:26:34,183
I may never see her again,
so I came to say good-bye.

1043
01:26:34,286 --> 01:26:36,186
We will tell her for you.

1044
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:38,917
We are sure
her heart goes with you.

1045
01:26:39,026 --> 01:26:41,085
Thank you, Your Highness.

1046
01:26:55,077 --> 01:26:59,138
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

1047
01:27:05,955 --> 01:27:10,359
Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate,

1048
01:27:10,461 --> 01:27:12,861
a tragedy has occurred...

1049
01:27:12,963 --> 01:27:16,490
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

1050
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:19,627
and has now engulfed
our entire planet...

1051
01:27:19,738 --> 01:27:21,729
in the oppression
of the Trade Federation.

1052
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,070
This is outrageous!

1053
01:27:24,176 --> 01:27:26,737
I object to
the senator's statements.

1054
01:27:26,846 --> 01:27:30,907
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

1055
01:27:31,017 --> 01:27:34,886
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala,

1056
01:27:34,988 --> 01:27:36,979
recently elected
ruler of the Naboo,

1057
01:27:37,124 --> 01:27:39,024
who speaks on our behalf.

1058
01:27:45,033 --> 01:27:47,763
Honorable representatives
of the Republic,

1059
01:27:47,869 --> 01:27:50,998
I come to you under
the gravest of circumstances.

1060
01:27:51,107 --> 01:27:54,099
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade...

1061
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:57,669
I object!
There is no proof!

1062
01:27:57,781 --> 01:27:59,681
This is incredible.

1063
01:27:59,783 --> 01:28:03,845
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

1064
01:28:03,955 --> 01:28:06,150
The Congress of Malastare concurs...

1065
01:28:06,257 --> 01:28:09,055
with the honorable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1066
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,561
- A commission must be appointed.
- The point...

1067
01:28:11,697 --> 01:28:14,825
- Excuse me, Chancellor.
- Enter the bureaucrat.

1068
01:28:14,967 --> 01:28:17,629
The true rulers
of the Republic.

1069
01:28:17,736 --> 01:28:21,901
And on the payroll of
the Trade Federation, I might add.

1070
01:28:22,008 --> 01:28:26,240
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

1071
01:28:27,815 --> 01:28:30,147
The point is conceded.

1072
01:28:30,251 --> 01:28:33,152
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission...

1073
01:28:33,254 --> 01:28:35,780
to explore the validity
of your accusations?

1074
01:28:35,891 --> 01:28:37,791
I will not defer.

1075
01:28:37,893 --> 01:28:41,385
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.

1076
01:28:41,496 --> 01:28:44,523
I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...

1077
01:28:44,667 --> 01:28:47,295
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1078
01:28:49,605 --> 01:28:52,666
If this body
is not capable of action,

1079
01:28:52,776 --> 01:28:55,802
I suggest new leadership
is needed.

1080
01:28:57,548 --> 01:29:00,450
I move for a vote
of no confidence...

1081
01:29:00,552 --> 01:29:02,543
in Chancellor Valorum's
leadership.

1082
01:29:09,628 --> 01:29:11,789
Vote now!
Vote now!

1083
01:29:11,897 --> 01:29:14,662
Vote now!
Vote now!

1084
01:29:14,768 --> 01:29:17,498
Vote now! Vote now!
Order!

1085
01:29:17,637 --> 01:29:20,538
Now they will elect
a new chancellor,

1086
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,541
a strong chancellor,

1087
01:29:22,643 --> 01:29:25,544
one who will not let
our tragedy continue.

1088
01:29:27,248 --> 01:29:31,549
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

1089
01:29:31,653 --> 01:29:34,622
Anakin will become a Jedi,
I promise you.

1090
01:29:34,723 --> 01:29:37,625
Do not defy the council,
Master, not again.

1091
01:29:37,727 --> 01:29:40,457
I shall do what I must,
Obi-Wan.

1092
01:29:42,365 --> 01:29:46,097
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

1093
01:29:46,203 --> 01:29:49,331
They will not go along
with you this time.

1094
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:52,375
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

1095
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:58,581
A ship.

1096
01:29:58,683 --> 01:30:00,652
A cup.

1097
01:30:00,753 --> 01:30:02,550
A ship.

1098
01:30:03,656 --> 01:30:06,147
A speeder.

1099
01:30:08,161 --> 01:30:10,061
Hmm.

1100
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:14,599
How feel you?

1101
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:16,602
Cold, sir.

1102
01:30:17,839 --> 01:30:19,704
Afraid are you?

1103
01:30:19,807 --> 01:30:21,741
No, sir.

1104
01:30:21,843 --> 01:30:24,472
See through you we can.

1105
01:30:24,613 --> 01:30:26,513
Be mindful of your feelings.

1106
01:30:26,615 --> 01:30:29,379
Your thoughts dwell
on your mother.

1107
01:30:31,053 --> 01:30:33,545
- I miss her.
- Mmm.

1108
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:36,181
Afraid to lose her,
I think, mmm?

1109
01:30:36,293 --> 01:30:38,454
What has that got to do
with anything?

1110
01:30:38,561 --> 01:30:40,894
Everything.

1111
01:30:40,998 --> 01:30:44,058
Fear is the path
to the dark side.

1112
01:30:44,168 --> 01:30:47,070
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate.

1113
01:30:47,172 --> 01:30:50,539
Hate leads to suffering.

1114
01:30:57,083 --> 01:30:59,984
I sense much fear in you.

1115
01:31:12,901 --> 01:31:16,302
Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?

1116
01:31:16,404 --> 01:31:18,305
I don't know.

1117
01:31:18,407 --> 01:31:20,967
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1118
01:31:22,745 --> 01:31:25,441
I hope not.

1119
01:31:25,548 --> 01:31:28,177
Gungans no dyin'
without a fight.

1120
01:31:28,285 --> 01:31:30,185
Wesa warriors.

1121
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:33,722
Wesa got a grand army.

1122
01:31:33,825 --> 01:31:37,226
Dat's why you no liken us,
mesa tinks.

1123
01:31:37,328 --> 01:31:40,161
Your Highness?

1124
01:31:41,332 --> 01:31:43,460
Your Highness.

1125
01:31:43,569 --> 01:31:46,697
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

1126
01:31:46,805 --> 01:31:48,864
as supreme chancellor.

1127
01:31:48,974 --> 01:31:51,876
A surprise, to be sure,
but a welcome one.

1128
01:31:51,978 --> 01:31:56,677
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1129
01:31:56,783 --> 01:31:58,445
Who else has been nominated?

1130
01:31:58,552 --> 01:32:02,886
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1131
01:32:02,990 --> 01:32:07,928
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1132
01:32:09,664 --> 01:32:11,632
I will be chancellor.

1133
01:32:11,767 --> 01:32:14,396
I fear by the time you have
control of the bureaucrats,

1134
01:32:14,504 --> 01:32:17,735
there'll be nothing left of our people,
our way of life.

1135
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,740
I understand your concern,
Your Majesty.

1136
01:32:19,842 --> 01:32:23,370
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1137
01:32:25,149 --> 01:32:29,246
Senator, this is your arena.

1138
01:32:29,354 --> 01:32:31,254
I feel I must return to mine.

1139
01:32:33,892 --> 01:32:36,794
I've decided
to go back to Naboo.

1140
01:32:36,929 --> 01:32:38,897
Go back?
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.

1141
01:32:38,998 --> 01:32:40,898
They'll force you
to sign the treaty.

1142
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,400
I will sign no treaty,
Senator.

1143
01:32:43,502 --> 01:32:45,994
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1144
01:32:46,139 --> 01:32:48,039
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

1145
01:32:48,141 --> 01:32:50,041
Ready my ship.

1146
01:32:50,143 --> 01:32:53,841
Please, Your Majesty,
stay here where it's safe.

1147
01:32:53,948 --> 01:32:57,111
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.

1148
01:32:57,218 --> 01:33:01,553
I pray you will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.

1149
01:33:11,734 --> 01:33:14,294
The Force is strong with him.

1150
01:33:14,437 --> 01:33:16,338
He is to be trained, then?

1151
01:33:17,808 --> 01:33:20,868
No, he will not be trained.

1152
01:33:20,978 --> 01:33:22,639
No?

1153
01:33:24,683 --> 01:33:26,742
He is too old.

1154
01:33:26,852 --> 01:33:30,653
He is the chosen one.
You must see it.

1155
01:33:30,756 --> 01:33:35,386
Mmm. Clouded
this boy's future is.

1156
01:33:37,597 --> 01:33:39,395
I will train him, then.

1157
01:33:43,770 --> 01:33:46,604
I take Anakin
as my Padawan learner.

1158
01:33:46,708 --> 01:33:49,677
An apprentice you have,
Qui-Gon.

1159
01:33:49,777 --> 01:33:52,143
Impossible
to take on a second.

1160
01:33:52,247 --> 01:33:53,943
The code forbids it.

1161
01:33:54,049 --> 01:33:57,450
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

1162
01:33:57,553 --> 01:34:01,182
Our own counsel we will keep
on who is ready.

1163
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:03,191
He is headstrong,

1164
01:34:03,293 --> 01:34:06,660
and he has much to learn of
the living Force, but he is capable.

1165
01:34:06,763 --> 01:34:10,029
There is little more
he can learn from me.

1166
01:34:11,369 --> 01:34:13,234
Young Skywalker's fate...

1167
01:34:13,337 --> 01:34:15,168
will be decided later.

1168
01:34:15,273 --> 01:34:17,834
Now is not the time for this.

1169
01:34:17,976 --> 01:34:20,604
The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor,

1170
01:34:20,746 --> 01:34:23,408
and Queen Amidala
is returning home,

1171
01:34:23,549 --> 01:34:26,781
which will put pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.

1172
01:34:26,886 --> 01:34:29,184
And draw out
the queen's attacker.

1173
01:34:29,289 --> 01:34:33,693
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

1174
01:34:34,962 --> 01:34:36,862
This is the clue we need...

1175
01:34:36,964 --> 01:34:39,228
to unravel
the mystery of the Sith.

1176
01:34:39,333 --> 01:34:42,167
May the Force be with you.

1177
01:34:55,351 --> 01:34:58,253
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1178
01:34:58,355 --> 01:35:00,255
From your point of view.

1179
01:35:00,357 --> 01:35:03,758
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1180
01:35:03,860 --> 01:35:06,762
His fate is uncertain.
He's not dangerous.

1181
01:35:06,864 --> 01:35:09,264
The council will decide
Anakin's future.

1182
01:35:09,367 --> 01:35:12,269
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.

1183
01:35:18,143 --> 01:35:21,671
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1184
01:35:21,781 --> 01:35:24,011
You won't be, Ani.

1185
01:35:24,150 --> 01:35:28,212
I'm not allowed to train you, so I want
you to watch me and be mindful.

1186
01:35:28,356 --> 01:35:31,257
Always remember:

1187
01:35:31,359 --> 01:35:34,021
Your focus
determines your reality.

1188
01:35:34,128 --> 01:35:37,292
Stay close to me
and you'll be safe.

1189
01:35:37,399 --> 01:35:39,230
Master, sir,

1190
01:35:39,334 --> 01:35:42,930
I heard Yoda talking
about midi-chlorians.

1191
01:35:43,039 --> 01:35:46,566
I've been wondering...
What are midi-chlorians?

1192
01:35:47,844 --> 01:35:50,244
Midi-chlorians are
a microscopic life-form...

1193
01:35:50,346 --> 01:35:52,577
that resides
within all living cells.

1194
01:35:54,018 --> 01:35:56,919
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.

1195
01:35:57,021 --> 01:36:00,514
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

1196
01:36:00,659 --> 01:36:04,561
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1197
01:36:04,663 --> 01:36:07,565
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...

1198
01:36:07,667 --> 01:36:10,465
and we would have no
knowledge of the Force.

1199
01:36:10,569 --> 01:36:12,469
They continually speak to us,

1200
01:36:12,571 --> 01:36:15,268
telling us
the will of the Force.

1201
01:36:15,375 --> 01:36:17,502
When you learn
to quiet your mind,

1202
01:36:17,611 --> 01:36:19,511
you'll hear them
speaking to you.

1203
01:36:19,613 --> 01:36:21,513
I don't understand.

1204
01:36:21,615 --> 01:36:25,108
With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.

1205
01:36:28,923 --> 01:36:33,190
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.

1206
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:35,229
I welcome your help.

1207
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:38,733
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.

1208
01:36:38,835 --> 01:36:41,998
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

1209
01:36:42,105 --> 01:36:45,006
Wesa goin' ho-o-o-me!

1210
01:36:45,108 --> 01:36:48,010
Come on, R2.

1211
01:36:56,588 --> 01:36:59,614
Is the planet secure?

1212
01:36:59,725 --> 01:37:03,628
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1213
01:37:03,763 --> 01:37:06,823
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1214
01:37:06,966 --> 01:37:12,837
Good. I will see to it that in
the senate things stay as they are.

1215
01:37:12,940 --> 01:37:16,843
I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.

1216
01:37:16,945 --> 01:37:18,845
Yes, my lord.

1217
01:37:18,947 --> 01:37:20,847
A Sith here?

1218
01:37:26,255 --> 01:37:28,723
Those are
the forward stabilizers.

1219
01:37:28,824 --> 01:37:31,224
And those two
control the pitch?

1220
01:37:32,763 --> 01:37:34,663
You catch on pretty quick.

1221
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:36,665
As soon as we land,

1222
01:37:36,767 --> 01:37:39,497
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1223
01:37:39,636 --> 01:37:43,368
I agree. I'm not sure what
you wish to accomplish by this.

1224
01:37:43,474 --> 01:37:46,375
I will take back what's ours.

1225
01:37:46,477 --> 01:37:48,912
There are too few of us,
Your Highness.

1226
01:37:49,014 --> 01:37:50,914
We have no army.

1227
01:37:51,016 --> 01:37:54,577
And I can only protect you.
I can't fight a war for you.

1228
01:37:54,686 --> 01:37:56,678
JarJar Binks.

1229
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:59,782
Mesa, Your Highness?

1230
01:37:59,893 --> 01:38:02,794
Yes.
I need your help.

1231
01:38:08,002 --> 01:38:10,232
I have one battleship
on my scope.

1232
01:38:10,371 --> 01:38:12,431
It's a droid control ship.

1233
01:38:12,574 --> 01:38:14,474
They've probably spotted us.

1234
01:38:14,576 --> 01:38:16,567
We haven't much time.

1235
01:38:28,125 --> 01:38:32,027
- JarJar is on his way to the Gungan city, Master.
- Good.

1236
01:38:32,129 --> 01:38:35,031
Do you think the queen's idea
will work?

1237
01:38:35,133 --> 01:38:38,034
The Gungans will not
be easily swayed.

1238
01:38:38,136 --> 01:38:40,934
And we cannot use our power
to help her.

1239
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:45,836
I'm... I'm sorry for
my behavior, Master.

1240
01:38:45,978 --> 01:38:49,641
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.

1241
01:38:51,618 --> 01:38:54,917
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1242
01:38:56,056 --> 01:38:57,957
You've been a good apprentice,
Obi-Wan.

1243
01:38:59,393 --> 01:39:02,294
And you're a much wiser man
than I am.

1244
01:39:02,396 --> 01:39:06,163
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

1245
01:39:19,115 --> 01:39:21,516
Desa nobody dare.

1246
01:39:21,619 --> 01:39:23,780
The Gungan city is deserted.

1247
01:39:23,921 --> 01:39:26,446
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1248
01:39:26,590 --> 01:39:29,685
Do you think they have been
taken to the camps?

1249
01:39:29,794 --> 01:39:32,160
More likely
they were wiped out.

1250
01:39:32,264 --> 01:39:35,324
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are, JarJar?

1251
01:39:35,433 --> 01:39:38,870
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.

1252
01:39:38,971 --> 01:39:41,872
Mesa show you.
Come on. Mesa show you!

1253
01:39:59,427 --> 01:40:03,831
Your Honor,
Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1254
01:40:09,039 --> 01:40:13,840
Uh, h-heyo dadee,
Big Boss Nass, Your Honor.

1255
01:40:13,944 --> 01:40:17,039
JarJar Binks.

1256
01:40:17,148 --> 01:40:21,244
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1257
01:40:21,352 --> 01:40:23,651
I am Queen Amidala
of the Naboo.

1258
01:40:23,789 --> 01:40:26,883
I come before you in peace.

1259
01:40:27,025 --> 01:40:29,892
Ah, Naboo biggen.

1260
01:40:29,995 --> 01:40:33,193
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1261
01:40:33,299 --> 01:40:37,030
Yousa all bombad.

1262
01:40:37,136 --> 01:40:40,732
We have searched you out because
we wish to form an alliance.

1263
01:40:40,841 --> 01:40:42,741
Your Honor.

1264
01:40:44,411 --> 01:40:47,381
Whosa dis?

1265
01:40:47,482 --> 01:40:50,315
- I am Queen Amidala.
- Huh?

1266
01:40:51,353 --> 01:40:53,218
This is my decoy,

1267
01:40:53,321 --> 01:40:56,689
my protection,
my loyal bodyguard.

1268
01:40:56,792 --> 01:41:01,092
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

1269
01:41:01,230 --> 01:41:04,132
Although we do not
always agree, Your Honor,

1270
01:41:04,234 --> 01:41:07,135
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1271
01:41:07,237 --> 01:41:09,137
- Ah.
- The Trade Federation...

1272
01:41:09,239 --> 01:41:11,435
has destroyed all that we
have worked so hard to build.

1273
01:41:11,542 --> 01:41:14,841
If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1274
01:41:14,946 --> 01:41:17,176
I ask you to help us.

1275
01:41:17,281 --> 01:41:20,012
No, I beg you to help us.

1276
01:41:20,119 --> 01:41:22,485
We are your humble servants.

1277
01:41:24,957 --> 01:41:28,485
Our fate is in your hands.

1278
01:41:28,595 --> 01:41:31,086
Mmm.

1279
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:42,442
Ha!

1280
01:41:45,747 --> 01:41:50,014
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?

1281
01:41:52,488 --> 01:41:56,390
Me-e-esa lika dis!

1282
01:41:56,492 --> 01:41:58,324
Maybe...

1283
01:41:58,429 --> 01:42:00,954
wesa...

1284
01:42:01,065 --> 01:42:02,965
bein friends.

1285
01:42:08,173 --> 01:42:11,074
Yippee!
Ya-hoo!

1286
01:42:11,176 --> 01:42:13,509
We've sent our patrols.

1287
01:42:13,612 --> 01:42:17,104
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1288
01:42:17,216 --> 01:42:19,377
It won't be long, my lord.

1289
01:42:19,485 --> 01:42:22,649
This is an unexpected move
for her.

1290
01:42:22,756 --> 01:42:24,781
It's too aggressive.

1291
01:42:24,891 --> 01:42:27,325
Lord Maul, be mindful.

1292
01:42:27,427 --> 01:42:29,988
Let them make the first move.

1293
01:42:30,098 --> 01:42:31,998
Yes, my master.

1294
01:42:35,470 --> 01:42:37,166
Deysa comin!

1295
01:42:37,272 --> 01:42:39,638
All right!

1296
01:42:41,543 --> 01:42:43,444
They're here!

1297
01:42:43,546 --> 01:42:45,446
Good.
They made it.

1298
01:42:50,019 --> 01:42:51,920
Yousa doen grand.

1299
01:42:52,022 --> 01:42:55,924
JarJar bring uss-en
and da Naboo together.

1300
01:42:56,026 --> 01:42:57,926
Ah, no, no, no.

1301
01:42:58,028 --> 01:43:01,021
So, wesa make you...

1302
01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:03,158
bombad general.

1303
01:43:03,268 --> 01:43:05,634
General?

1304
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:09,708
Captain.

1305
01:43:09,809 --> 01:43:12,437
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?

1306
01:43:12,578 --> 01:43:14,479
Almost everyone's in camps.

1307
01:43:14,581 --> 01:43:17,812
A few hundred police and guards have
formed an underground resistance movement.

1308
01:43:17,918 --> 01:43:20,478
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.

1309
01:43:20,587 --> 01:43:25,252
The Federation army's also much larger
than we thought, and much stronger.

1310
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:29,660
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1311
01:43:29,764 --> 01:43:31,665
The battle is a diversion.

1312
01:43:31,767 --> 01:43:34,964
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1313
01:43:35,070 --> 01:43:37,630
R2.

1314
01:43:37,740 --> 01:43:41,336
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1315
01:43:41,444 --> 01:43:43,344
Once we get to
the main entrance,

1316
01:43:43,446 --> 01:43:46,245
Captain Panaka
will create a diversion.

1317
01:43:46,384 --> 01:43:49,319
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1318
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:52,685
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1319
01:43:52,790 --> 01:43:54,691
What do you think,
Master Jedi?

1320
01:43:54,793 --> 01:43:56,954
The viceroy will be
well-guarded.

1321
01:43:57,062 --> 01:43:59,462
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

1322
01:43:59,565 --> 01:44:02,000
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1323
01:44:02,101 --> 01:44:06,834
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1324
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:10,274
Wesa ready to do
our-san part.

1325
01:44:10,377 --> 01:44:13,505
We have a plan which
should immobilize the droid army.

1326
01:44:13,614 --> 01:44:15,514
We will send
what pilots we have...

1327
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:18,643
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1328
01:44:18,787 --> 01:44:21,847
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1329
01:44:21,990 --> 01:44:24,892
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1330
01:44:24,994 --> 01:44:26,894
There's an even bigger danger.

1331
01:44:26,996 --> 01:44:28,896
If the viceroy escapes,
Your Highness,

1332
01:44:28,998 --> 01:44:31,228
he will return
with another droid army.

1333
01:44:31,334 --> 01:44:34,566
Well, that is why we must not
fail to get the viceroy.

1334
01:44:34,671 --> 01:44:36,798
Everything depends on it.

1335
01:44:41,913 --> 01:44:44,507
She is more foolish
than I thought.

1336
01:44:44,616 --> 01:44:49,554
We are sending all troops to meet
this army assembling near the swamp.

1337
01:44:49,655 --> 01:44:52,317
It appears to be made up
of primitives.

1338
01:44:52,458 --> 01:44:54,983
This will work
to our advantage.

1339
01:44:55,127 --> 01:44:57,926
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord?

1340
01:44:58,031 --> 01:45:00,431
Wipe them out.

1341
01:45:02,135 --> 01:45:04,036
All of them.

1342
01:45:34,906 --> 01:45:36,806
Halt!

1343
01:45:39,744 --> 01:45:42,008
Starting up the shield.

1344
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:12,738
Open fire.

1345
01:46:28,165 --> 01:46:32,068
Once we get inside, you find
a safe place to hide and stay there.

1346
01:46:32,204 --> 01:46:34,104
- Sure.
- Stay there.

1347
01:46:50,090 --> 01:46:52,149
Roger. Roger.

1348
01:47:00,168 --> 01:47:03,263
I thought the battle was going
to take place far from here.

1349
01:47:03,372 --> 01:47:05,863
This is too close.

1350
01:47:11,048 --> 01:47:12,515
Ani, find cover.

1351
01:47:14,384 --> 01:47:16,649
- Quick!
- Get to your ships!

1352
01:47:28,934 --> 01:47:30,765
Aah!

1353
01:47:43,050 --> 01:47:44,984
Aah!

1354
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:17,820
- Fighters straight ahead.
- Roger, Bravo Leader.

1355
01:48:17,922 --> 01:48:19,151
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1356
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,900
Cease fire.

1357
01:48:36,477 --> 01:48:38,843
Steady. Steady.

1358
01:49:12,017 --> 01:49:15,181
- Activate the droids.
- Yes, sir.

1359
01:49:31,739 --> 01:49:33,639
Ouch time.

1360
01:49:47,724 --> 01:49:50,090
Fire!

1361
01:49:50,193 --> 01:49:52,321
Whoa-ohh!

1362
01:50:02,774 --> 01:50:05,038
Aah! Whoa!

1363
01:50:10,450 --> 01:50:12,975
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1364
01:50:13,086 --> 01:50:16,488
Red group! Blue group!
Everybody, this way!

1365
01:50:16,590 --> 01:50:18,581
Hey, wait for me!

1366
01:50:18,692 --> 01:50:21,092
Stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.

1367
01:50:21,195 --> 01:50:23,596
- But I...
- Stay in that cockpit.

1368
01:50:35,411 --> 01:50:38,643
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1369
01:50:58,837 --> 01:51:00,771
We gotta do something, R2.

1370
01:51:23,565 --> 01:51:26,535
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

1371
01:51:29,839 --> 01:51:33,037
Oops, wrong one.
Maybe it's this one.

1372
01:51:33,177 --> 01:51:34,410
Nope. Wait.
Here it is.

1373
01:51:34,411 --> 01:51:36,504
Nope. Wait.
Here it is.

1374
01:51:37,748 --> 01:51:40,216
Yeah!

1375
01:51:45,090 --> 01:51:47,581
Let's go!

1376
01:51:47,692 --> 01:51:49,923
It's on automatic pilot.

1377
01:51:58,972 --> 01:52:02,305
Try to override it.

1378
01:53:00,408 --> 01:53:02,876
We don't have time
for this, Captain.

1379
01:53:08,984 --> 01:53:10,849
Look! There they are.

1380
01:53:10,953 --> 01:53:13,319
That's where
the autopilot's taking us.

1381
01:53:24,001 --> 01:53:27,061
Huh? Waaah!
Aah! Aah!

1382
01:53:27,171 --> 01:53:29,071
Aah!

1383
01:53:29,173 --> 01:53:33,008
Aaah! Hmm!
Dumb droid. Take that!

1384
01:53:33,111 --> 01:53:36,342
Get off! Get off!
Get off! Get off!

1385
01:53:36,448 --> 01:53:38,383
Ooh! Ooh! Mooie!

1386
01:53:38,485 --> 01:53:40,783
Whoo-hoo! Aah!

1387
01:53:46,393 --> 01:53:48,759
The deflector shield
is too strong.

1388
01:53:57,138 --> 01:53:59,402
This is tense!

1389
01:54:00,843 --> 01:54:03,744
Whoa! R2, get us
off this autopilot.

1390
01:54:03,846 --> 01:54:06,041
It's gonna
get us both killed.

1391
01:54:06,148 --> 01:54:10,142
You did it, R2!

1392
01:54:10,254 --> 01:54:11,915
Okay, let's go left.

1393
01:54:15,025 --> 01:54:17,790
Go back?

1394
01:54:17,896 --> 01:54:22,196
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1395
01:54:29,108 --> 01:54:31,576
I'll try spinning.
That's a good trick.

1396
01:54:31,677 --> 01:54:33,646
Whoa!

1397
01:54:35,615 --> 01:54:39,780
I know we're in trouble. Just hang on.

1398
01:54:46,594 --> 01:54:48,620
Go!

1399
01:54:52,467 --> 01:54:54,162
Ascension guns!

1400
01:57:00,312 --> 01:57:01,939
Retreat! Retreat!

1401
01:57:03,716 --> 01:57:05,616
Dis is nutsen.

1402
01:57:05,751 --> 01:57:07,686
Hyah!

1403
01:57:08,955 --> 01:57:10,820
O-O-Ohh!

1404
01:57:15,529 --> 01:57:17,497
Uh-oh.
Big boomers.

1405
01:57:17,598 --> 01:57:20,260
Ohh! Ohh!

1406
01:57:24,873 --> 01:57:27,034
Uh-oh! Aaah!

1407
01:57:35,718 --> 01:57:38,118
Hey! Hey!

1408
01:57:38,221 --> 01:57:41,817
Give me a lift!
Aaah! Oh!

1409
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:44,985
Aaah!

1410
01:57:46,130 --> 01:57:47,792
Ohh!

1411
01:57:47,899 --> 01:57:49,526
JarJar, usen da booma!

1412
01:57:49,634 --> 01:57:51,568
What?
Mesa no have a booma!

1413
01:57:51,669 --> 01:57:53,637
Here. Taken dis one.

1414
01:57:53,738 --> 01:57:56,799
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Aah!

1415
01:57:58,010 --> 01:57:59,637
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1416
01:57:59,745 --> 01:58:02,738
Whoa-ohh!

1417
01:58:02,849 --> 01:58:04,749
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1418
01:58:04,851 --> 01:58:06,341
Aaah!

1419
01:58:06,453 --> 01:58:08,683
Help me!

1420
01:58:09,790 --> 01:58:13,249
JarJar!
Jump, JarJar, jump!

1421
01:58:22,938 --> 01:58:26,204
Put down your weapons.
They win this round.

1422
01:58:39,089 --> 01:58:41,251
We're hit, R2!
Aah!

1423
01:58:46,298 --> 01:58:48,562
Aaah!

1424
01:58:54,473 --> 01:58:57,466
I'm trying to stop!
I'm trying to stop!

1425
01:59:04,686 --> 01:59:06,210
Everything's overheated.

1426
01:59:06,321 --> 01:59:09,654
Oops. This is not good.

1427
01:59:55,242 --> 01:59:59,111
No!

1428
02:00:21,738 --> 02:00:24,264
No giben up, General JarJar.

1429
02:00:24,375 --> 02:00:26,275
Mesa tink of something.

1430
02:00:26,411 --> 02:00:28,845
- Hands up.
- My give up.

1431
02:00:28,947 --> 02:00:30,848
My give up.

1432
02:00:39,526 --> 02:00:42,654
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.

1433
02:00:42,762 --> 02:00:46,665
Time for you to sign the treaty and end
this pointless debate in the senate.

1434
02:00:46,767 --> 02:00:48,564
Viceroy!

1435
02:00:48,669 --> 02:00:50,603
Your occupation here
has ended.

1436
02:00:52,139 --> 02:00:55,507
After her.
This one's a decoy.

1437
02:01:02,118 --> 02:01:04,678
Captain!

1438
02:01:12,296 --> 02:01:14,890
Jam the doors.

1439
02:01:17,702 --> 02:01:21,263
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.

1440
02:02:23,509 --> 02:02:25,807
Yes! We have power.

1441
02:02:25,912 --> 02:02:28,381
Shields up.

1442
02:02:30,217 --> 02:02:31,878
Take this!

1443
02:02:33,253 --> 02:02:35,688
And this!

1444
02:02:35,790 --> 02:02:37,690
Whoa!

1445
02:02:42,263 --> 02:02:44,164
- Oops.
- We're losing power.

1446
02:02:44,266 --> 02:02:47,463
- There seems to be a problem with the main reactor.
- Impossible!

1447
02:02:47,570 --> 02:02:49,470
Nothing can get
through our shield.

1448
02:02:50,740 --> 02:02:53,470
Let's get outta here.

1449
02:03:00,618 --> 02:03:03,246
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1450
02:03:06,258 --> 02:03:07,816
We didn't hit it.

1451
02:03:10,929 --> 02:03:14,457
Now, this is Podracing.

1452
02:03:14,601 --> 02:03:18,332
- Look, one of ours, out of the main hold!
- Whoo!

1453
02:03:22,776 --> 02:03:24,367
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

1454
02:03:24,392 --> 02:03:25,769
Hee-hee!

1455
02:03:36,024 --> 02:03:39,153
What the...

1456
02:03:39,262 --> 02:03:41,526
Was'n they doing?

1457
02:03:41,631 --> 02:03:45,193
The control ship has
been destroyed. Look!

1458
02:03:46,937 --> 02:03:49,303
They all broke-ed.

1459
02:04:37,694 --> 02:04:41,096
No, it... it's too late.

1460
02:04:41,198 --> 02:04:43,530
- No.
- Obi-Wan.

1461
02:04:44,802 --> 02:04:46,667
Promise...

1462
02:04:46,770 --> 02:04:49,001
Promise me
you will train the boy.

1463
02:04:49,107 --> 02:04:51,007
Yes, Master.

1464
02:04:54,679 --> 02:04:57,672
He is the chosen one.

1465
02:04:57,817 --> 02:05:01,048
He... will bring balance.

1466
02:05:02,255 --> 02:05:04,156
Train him.

1467
02:05:31,187 --> 02:05:33,018
Now, Viceroy,

1468
02:05:33,123 --> 02:05:36,525
you're going to have to go back
to the senate and explain all this.

1469
02:05:38,262 --> 02:05:41,562
I think you can kiss your
trade franchise good-bye.

1470
02:05:55,281 --> 02:05:58,809
We are indebted to you for
your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1471
02:05:58,952 --> 02:06:00,852
And you, young Skywalker.

1472
02:06:00,954 --> 02:06:04,914
We will watch your career
with great interest.

1473
02:06:11,466 --> 02:06:14,061
Congratulations on your election,
Chancellor.

1474
02:06:14,170 --> 02:06:17,606
Your boldness has saved
our people, Your Majesty.

1475
02:06:17,707 --> 02:06:20,107
It's you who should be
congratulated.

1476
02:06:20,209 --> 02:06:24,112
Together we shall bring peace
and prosperity to the Republic.

1477
02:06:28,519 --> 02:06:33,582
Confer on you the level of
Jedi knight the council does.

1478
02:06:33,725 --> 02:06:38,459
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

1479
02:06:38,564 --> 02:06:40,464
I do not.

1480
02:06:40,566 --> 02:06:42,625
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1481
02:06:45,105 --> 02:06:48,006
The chosen one
the boy may be.

1482
02:06:48,108 --> 02:06:50,008
Nevertheless,

1483
02:06:50,110 --> 02:06:53,012
grave danger I fear
in his training.

1484
02:06:53,114 --> 02:06:56,641
Master Yoda,
I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1485
02:06:56,751 --> 02:06:58,651
I will train Anakin.

1486
02:06:58,719 --> 02:07:01,120
Ohh!

1487
02:07:01,223 --> 02:07:04,124
Without the approval of the council,
if I must.

1488
02:07:04,226 --> 02:07:06,626
Qui-Gon's defiance
I sense in you.

1489
02:07:06,762 --> 02:07:08,663
Need that you do not.

1490
02:07:10,767 --> 02:07:14,032
Agree with you
the council does.

1491
02:07:15,139 --> 02:07:18,438
Your apprentice
Skywalker will be.

1492
02:07:45,572 --> 02:07:48,041
What will happen to me now?

1493
02:07:48,142 --> 02:07:51,202
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1494
02:07:51,312 --> 02:07:54,714
You will be a Jedi,
I promise.

1495
02:08:03,526 --> 02:08:06,552
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1496
02:08:06,663 --> 02:08:10,100
Mmm.
Always two there are.

1497
02:08:10,201 --> 02:08:13,295
No more, no less.

1498
02:08:13,437 --> 02:08:16,167
A master and an apprentice.

1499
02:08:16,307 --> 02:08:18,208
But which was destroyed?

1500
02:08:18,310 --> 02:08:21,245
The master or the apprentice?

1501
02:08:45,874 --> 02:08:47,933
Hello, everybody!

1502
02:09:34,595 --> 02:09:36,530
Peace!

1503
02:09:36,631 --> 02:09:39,464
Ya-hoo!
