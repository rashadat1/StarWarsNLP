1
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,394
<i>Victory on Geonosis!</i>

2
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,604
<i>After a massive planetary siege,</i>

3
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,275
<i>the Separatist forces on Geonosis
have finally fallen.</i>

4
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,819
<i>Key weapons factories
have been destroyed,</i>

5
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,780
<i>but at a heavy cost to Republic troops.</i>

6
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:36,452
<i>Now, as Jedi Master Luminara Unduli
and Obi-Wan Kenobi</i>

7
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:40,122
<i>begin a cleanup of the planet,
they launch an intense campaign</i>

8
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:45,210
<i>to find Separatist leader Poggle the Lesser
and bring him to justice.</i>

9
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,468
Sorry to leave you here, Rex.
There's still a lot to do.

10
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,970
You two have done enough
destroying that factory.

11
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,474
Go get some rest.
We'll let General Kenobi take it from here.

12
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,476
We'll be back before you know it,
Captain Rex.

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,186
We're ready, sir.

14
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:25,417
- A hard-won victory.
- lndeed. And a costly one.

15
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:29,671
We suffer a great many losses
in these battles. Too many.

16
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,342
The battles do appear to be coming
with growing frequency.

17
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:36,345
- No sign of Poggle, then?
- Nothing.

18
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:40,682
We have clone squadrons spread out
all over the area, but no hits yet.

19
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,185
l'll go out and find some clue
as to where he went.

20
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,478
l'm sure the clones can handle...

21
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:48,023
Poggle has too much information
about the Separatists to let him get away.

22
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,733
Very well, Master Unduli.

23
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,861
Just make sure to leave a bit
of strategic planning for me

24
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:57,199
when l come back, Master Kenobi.
l'd hate to feel left out.

25
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,711
We lost one!

26
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:16,385
Lord Poggle says leave it.
We gotta keep moving.

27
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:27,062
What's this?
l didn't expect to find you up and about.

28
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,231
After enough time in a bacta tank,

29
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,734
one longs for the mundane comfort
of star charts.

30
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,572
lt seems like it did you some good.
Your wound looks almost healed.

31
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,575
l wish l could say the same
for most of my men.

32
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,829
Well, let's make sure we don't have
to take Geonosis a third time.

33
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,915
Poggle's forces seem to have come
from the northern hemisphere.

34
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,252
And where was Master Unduli's
last contact made from?

35
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,504
This region, farther to the west,

36
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,424
but there's nothing out there
according to our latest intel.

37
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,511
- There.
- Where?

38
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,430
150 clicks southeast.

39
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:08,061
<i>lt appears to be a munitions container
of some kind.</i>

40
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,897
lt could just be debris.

41
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:13,442
l don't think so.
There was no battle in this area.

42
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:17,905
lt looks like Poggle was on a direct course,
11 mark 72, that way.

43
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,490
Headed directly for the Progate Temple.

44
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,075
<i>That makes no sense.</i>

45
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,828
<i>Nothing in the temple could have survived
the munitions we used</i>

46
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:28,874
<i>in the first wave of our attack.
Why would he risk exposure to go there?</i>

47
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,584
l'm not yet sure.

48
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:34,129
Perhaps he doesn't realize the extent
to which we cleared that area.

49
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:38,133
Master Luminara, l'm tracking a sandstorm
that's heading your way.

50
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,301
<i>No matter.</i>

51
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:43,222
<i>Poggle is out in the open, and l intend
to grab him before he can get off-world.</i>

52
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,683
l advise against it.
You might get lost in the storm.

53
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,561
<i>Then we'd have to find
both you and Poggle.</i>

54
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,980
l feel it is a risk worth taking.

55
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,357
<i>As you wish.</i>

56
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,609
Let's go.

57
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:14,253
- OM-5, are you still there?
- Yes. l think l'm right next to you.

58
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,089
Where is Lord Poggle taking us?

59
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,509
OM-5? OM-5!

60
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,764
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

61
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,394
Don't leave me.

62
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,525
l can't track Poggle in this storm.

63
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:40,362
We'll reach the temple soon.
We can get out of the storm there.

64
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,379
What could be taking her so long?
Something must have happened.

65
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,882
Patience, Skywalker.
lt's a delicate operation.

66
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,885
l'm sure we'll have more information soon.

67
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,765
l must admit, l am troubled
that we've not heard from her.

68
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,767
Let's not start worrying yet.

69
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,937
Luminara's not one
to take unnecessary risks.

70
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,244
You were right. He's here somewhere.

71
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,847
Master Kenobi.

72
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:52,559
We tracked Poggle to the Progate Temple,
but now there's no sign of him.

73
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,228
<i>Go no further until we can send support.</i>

74
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,772
<i>The storm is making things difficult.</i>

75
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,024
<i>We can barely read
your transmission as it is.</i>

76
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,578
Are you sure he went into the temple?

77
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,707
<i>Yes, we saw him enter, but l think
he's gone down into the catacombs below.</i>

78
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:19,127
Those catacombs go on for miles.
l fear we may have lost him.

79
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,545
Get yourself out of there.

80
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,049
Master Unduli? Master Unduli!

81
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,134
We've lost the connection.

82
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,595
- Where are you going?
- Take a guess.

83
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,807
We'll never get to her in this storm.
The gunships can't handle it.

84
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:36,478
- We can't wait!
- l'm sorry, Skywalker. We have no choice.

85
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,606
We must be patient
and trust in Master Unduli.

86
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,317
We'll leave as soon as the storm lifts.

87
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,506
Stay alert, everyone.

88
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,842
Spread out and look around, men.

89
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,846
General.

90
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,683
Buzz is dead.

91
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,185
- Any sign of Luminara?
- No, sir.

92
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,398
There was a struggle.

93
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,196
This is not a good sign.

94
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,366
Luminara's lightsaber.

95
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,035
Poggle didn't do this.

96
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,705
But maybe that did.

97
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,667
That is one ugly bug.

98
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,337
l haven't seen one
that looks like that before.

99
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,717
l don't believe anyone has.
lt could be the Geonosian queen.

100
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,387
- The bugs have a queen?
- Mmm. Rumored.

101
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,973
But we haven't found
any proof of her existence.

102
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,058
Until now.

103
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,561
This way.

104
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,271
Come on, men, let's move.

105
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,674
This leads to a dead end.

106
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,596
This one goes down the furthest.

107
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,974
- Sir, l'd say that's our best bet.
- l'll go first.

108
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,330
Master Kenobi!

109
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,420
<i>lf you're following me,
you must leave this place. Just get out!</i>

110
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,380
l repeat, fall back!

111
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,260
She must be close by. Come on!

112
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,855
l don't like the looks of this.

113
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,032
Look out!

114
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,123
l can't stop them!

115
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,926
Oh, no! No!

116
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,847
Back, everyone! Back!

117
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,350
Take out the tunnel supports!
lt's the only way!

118
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,905
What were those things?
We couldn't kill them.

119
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:01,576
l've heard stories of a Geonosian hive mind
so powerful, so strong,

120
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:06,289
that it can maintain its connection
with its warriors even after they have died.

121
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,708
And you think
that's why we couldn't kill them?

122
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,586
- Because they're...
- Already dead, yes.

123
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:15,590
- That can't be true. That's impossible!
- lmpossible or not,

124
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:20,095
these creatures keep moving
after we cut them up or shoot them down.

125
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,599
Call for reinforcements.

126
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:32,357
- There's no signal.
- We must be too deep underground.

127
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,153
You two, head back to the surface
and contact General Mundi.

128
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,281
- Tell him we need reinforcements.
- Yes, sir.

129
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,285
l won't be unhappy to get out
from under all this dirt.

130
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,748
This place gives me the shivers.

131
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,258
Wind's probably
playing tricks on us, right?

132
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,634
Look around. There's nothing...

133
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:01,845
What the...

134
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,305
Blast them!

135
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,309
They're not going down!

136
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,103
We have to turn back!

137
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,317
Gearshift!

138
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,799
Obviously the thing is a lot more powerful
than we assumed.

139
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,635
l'm going to the surface
to alert General Mundi myself.

140
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,472
l think that would be
a foolhardy move, Anakin.

141
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,348
We can't divide our troops again.

142
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,018
We don't have time to double back
to the surface.

143
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,521
Every moment we waste
puts Luminara in greater danger.

144
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,475
The air is warmer here.
We must be getting close.

145
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,269
Forget the heat.

146
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,272
- lt smells down here.
- Keep your voice down.

147
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,943
l'm just saying.
This planet is rotten from the inside out.

148
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,118
l've got a bad feeling about this.

149
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,913
lt must be the queen.

150
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,249
- Any sign of Luminara?
- l see her.

151
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,917
She's suspended near the throne.

152
00:13:56,126 --> 00:14:00,505
- Perfect. What about Poggle?
- He's speaking with the queen.

153
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:04,592
Good. You take the soldiers,
l'll take the queen.

154
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,428
Must you always rush into things?

155
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,474
Oh, no. You don't actually want
to talk to it, do you?

156
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,725
Matter of fact, l do.

157
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:16,062
Anakin, don't you wonder
why they took Luminara captive?

158
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,440
- Why not just kill her?
- She's leverage. She's a hostage.

159
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,944
Leverage for what?
No, there's something else going on here,

160
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,988
and these zombies are connected to it.

161
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,156
Fine. We'll try it your way.

162
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,741
So glad you agree.

163
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,785
Cody, set your men up
around the perimeter.

164
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,328
These creatures live in darkness.

165
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,290
The light from your helmet
should blind them temporarily.

166
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,791
Turn your lamps on at my signal.

167
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,919
They should create enough confusion
for us to get Luminara out of here.

168
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,130
But what happens when the bugs pursue?

169
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,465
You've seen them in action, sir.
We can't kill them.

170
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,260
We'll have to bury them.
lt'll at least slow them down.

171
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,471
Shoot out the support pillars
and this whole place will collapse.

172
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,098
Let's go!

173
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,957
How did you know
they wouldn't just attack us?

174
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:24,005
Because l make observations,
while you think with your lightsaber.

175
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,181
Well, that quick thinking of mine
is usually needed

176
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,308
when your observations
get us into trouble.

177
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:39,812
Anakin, the queen took Luminara hostage.
She wanted a Jedi, now she has two more.

178
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,689
l want to know what she's after.

179
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:49,197
Well, when this doesn't go as planned,
which it won't, l'll be ready.

180
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,907
That is so reassuring.

181
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,872
l thought l told you not to follow me,
Master Kenobi.

182
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,208
Yes, well, l took a lesson from Anakin

183
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,628
- and decided not to follow orders.
- Hey!

184
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,546
You.

185
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:10,009
You are the creatures

186
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:14,055
that attack Geonosia.

187
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:21,062
Why have you come before me?

188
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:25,316
Your Majesty,
it is a pleasure to finally meet you.

189
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,820
l am Obi-Wan Kenobi,
and this is Anakin Skywalker.

190
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:32,907
lt is our sad duty to inform you
that your rule is at an end.

191
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:40,331
You not dictate to me, Jedi!

192
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:47,338
My empire is forever!

193
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,926
l'm afraid it does not appear
that way, Your Grace.

194
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,888
You shall release the Jedi Luminara
and submit to Republic law.

195
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:10,862
l no submit to you!

196
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,991
No, patience, Anakin. Wait.

197
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,791
Majesty, destroying us shall only make
the Republic's judgment of you harsher.

198
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:30,298
No, Jedi. No!

199
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,635
l no destroy you,

200
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:38,556
l devour you!

201
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,226
l control you.

202
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:49,942
l had but one Jedi before
young Poggle bring me,

203
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:56,741
but now l have three!

204
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:02,663
Now, watch as my child

205
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:07,085
enters your Jedi friend.

206
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,338
And once inside,

207
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:16,344
her mind becomes my mind,

208
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:21,099
her thoughts, my thoughts.

209
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:25,061
lt's a sort of mind control, a hive mind.
She thinks she can possess us.

210
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,438
Great. Find out everything
you wanted to know yet?

211
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,273
No, wait, l want to see how it works.

212
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,026
l don't think Luminara wants to see
how it works.

213
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,528
No, l don't.

214
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,738
l'm curious. The more we know, the better.

215
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,866
l disagree!

216
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,910
- So do l.
- Come, now, the nose or the ear?

217
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,203
Which do you think it will enter?

218
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,709
- l think the nose.
- l hope this is part of the plan.

219
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,088
lsn't it always? Cody! Now!

220
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,316
You're coming with us, Poggle!

221
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,328
Obi-Wan, look out!

222
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,248
What? Anakin, no!

223
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,167
Got it.

224
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,086
What are you doing?
l was going to study that!

225
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,922
Study the bottom of my boot.
Come on, let's get out of here!

226
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,465
Here they come!

227
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,972
Take out the supports!

228
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,163
They're still coming!

229
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,343
This is our way out.

230
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,763
Start climbing.

231
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,324
Obi-Wan, look out!

232
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:43,384
All things considered,
that went better than l expected.

233
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,512
l wish we could have gotten
one of those worms.

234
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:50,391
Knowing how the queen controls
her minions could have proven valuable.

235
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:53,060
Well, hopefully the secret
is buried with her.
