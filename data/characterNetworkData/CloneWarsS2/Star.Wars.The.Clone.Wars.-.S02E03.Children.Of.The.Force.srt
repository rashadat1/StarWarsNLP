1
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,102
<i>A thief hunted!</i>

2
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,981
<i>ln a daring assault, Anakin Skywalker
and his Padawan, Ahsoka,</i>

3
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:27,443
<i>boarded the warship
of cunning bounty hunter Cad Bane</i>

4
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,361
<i>to recover a stolen holocron</i>

5
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,281
<i>containing a list
of the galaxy's Force-sensitive children</i>

6
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,283
<i>and future Jedi Knights.</i>

7
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,077
<i>After a desperate chase
and duel with the villain,</i>

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,413
<i>Anakin and his troops defeated Bane</i>

9
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:43,792
<i>but were forced to evacuate his doomed
vessel without the holocron.</i>

10
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,306
How many made it off this time?

11
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,474
Just us.

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,144
Hey, Denal, good job
frying that bounty hunter.

13
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,564
Yeah, let's get some grub. You hungry?

14
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,149
l'll catch up.

15
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,276
So, what now?

16
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,278
Now we get the injured
to the medical bay.

17
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,656
General! There's something
l think you should see.

18
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,495
Hey, trooper! Are you all right?

19
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,957
Must have been hit in the head.

20
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,961
lt's blood, sir.
And it sure isn't from any of our men.

21
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,425
Wait! You're injured.
That might be serious.

22
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,097
- You're no clone!
- Ahsoka!

23
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,995
Admiral, lock down
the hyperspace rings. Hurry!

24
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:06,041
What could possibly have happened
since l last spoke with you?

25
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:11,421
lt's Bane. Lock those rings now!

26
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,386
- No, lock them all down. Hurry!
- Deactivating hyperspace rings.

27
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,058
We'll have to inform the Council.

28
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:36,238
lt is most unfortunate
Bane was allowed to escape again.

29
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,073
With access to the names and locations

30
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,826
of the most Force-sensitive children
in the Republic.

31
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,414
lnflict devastating damage
on the Jedi Order, he could.

32
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,292
We've discovered
Bane's working with the Separatists.

33
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:52,087
There are thousands of children
on that list. Which will he go after first?

34
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:57,467
Small chance there is, through the Force,
the Council may detect them.

35
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:02,764
l have delivered what you wanted.
The Jedi were no problem.

36
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:07,936
- Anything else l can help you with?
- <i>l need test subjects.</i>

37
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,773
<i>Choose four children
and bring them to Mustafar.</i>

38
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,942
<i>l will take care of them.</i>

39
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,905
Kidnapping innocent children?

40
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:21,200
Seems like a small-time crime
for the likes of you.

41
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:25,621
<i>Among the children of the Jedi,
there are no innocents.</i>

42
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,122
Sure, sure.

43
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:31,585
As long as l get paid,
it makes no difference to me.

44
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:38,383
A jungle world, domed cities l see,

45
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,220
Rodia it is.

46
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:47,434
A house in Kay Tap square.
Yes, l see it, too.

47
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:52,189
There's an ocean planet,
home to Nautolans.

48
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:57,069
- Glee Anselm?
- Glee Anselm l see not.

49
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:01,490
l sense a place l've been to before.

50
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,993
Waterfalls. Naboo.

51
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:10,707
Jan-gwa, a village, southern sector.
Sense it strongly l do.

52
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:16,838
- The Gungan child was screaming.
- The future you see, young Skywalker.

53
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:21,343
To Naboo you must go.
Cad Bane you will find.

54
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,595
With you take your Padawan.

55
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,765
You're certain
there is no child on Glee Anselm?

56
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,352
lnto the shadow of the dark side
taken the child was.

57
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,397
Shrouded is his fate from us.

58
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:38,110
Great the loss is,
but more children in danger there are.

59
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:43,490
- l shall leave for Rodia immediately.
- Find more younglings we will.

60
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:56,795
Your son is strong with the Force.
He will make a fine Jedi.

61
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,091
Master Ropal said the day would
come for him to go to the Temple,

62
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,051
but not for some time.

63
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:07,806
Master Ropal was unaware of the danger
your son is in.

64
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,018
Jedi imposters
have been roaming the galaxy,

65
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,520
stealing the future younglings.

66
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:17,399
For your son's protection,
l'm going to have to take him now.

67
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,901
He is my only child.

68
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:24,406
Look into this. lt will relax you.

69
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,460
Let's hope we have arrived in time.

70
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:05,322
lf you're looking for my son, Jedi,
he's not here.

71
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,157
Where is he?

72
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,368
Open the door!

73
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,456
You'll never get him!

74
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,918
- Where is the bounty hunter?
- Bounty hunter?

75
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,087
He was a Jedi.

76
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:26,218
- Jedi do not carry blasters.
- What have l done?

77
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,667
General Skywalker,
they told us you were coming.

78
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,669
Has the Gungan family been notified?

79
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,880
Yes. Captain Lunker here
is in charge of the operation.

80
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,882
He will take you to Jan-gwa City.

81
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,719
Let me take the lead, Master.
l've got a score to settle.

82
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,765
All right, go with the Gungan.
l'll be there shortly.

83
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,731
Don't move, <i>sleemo!</i>

84
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:06,067
You weren't the child
l was expecting to find.

85
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,362
- Obviously.
- You're quite clever,

86
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,572
but naive!

87
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,384
Looks like l win.

88
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,015
l think l've earned the right
to wear this again.

89
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,903
- Your daughter is safe now.
- Do you really believe that?

90
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,582
We know you've taken at least
two children. Where are they?

91
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,626
Beyond your reach.

92
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,712
- Who are you working for?
- l work alone.

93
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:11,633
lt is only a matter of time
before we locate the holocron.

94
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,969
Make it easier on yourself.

95
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,180
What are you going to do, Jedi,
torture me?

96
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:23,687
l think the fear of whoever you work for
outweighs your fear of us.

97
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,065
This conversation is over.

98
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:36,992
We tore the ship apart.
There's no sign of the holocron or the kids.

99
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,160
Did you check
the ship's navigation records?

100
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:42,205
They were wiped clean
before he landed on Naboo.

101
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,041
We'll have to use the Force
to make him talk.

102
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,460
l don't think Bane is that weak.

103
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,839
Maybe if we all concentrated
on his mind together.

104
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:56,219
Mmm. Using the Force to compel
a strong mind to cooperate is risky.

105
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,681
There is a danger that his mind
could be destroyed in the process.

106
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,683
Well, do we have another choice?

107
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:18,783
- You will take us to the holocron.
- Jedi mind tricks don't work on me.

108
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,369
You will take us to the holocron.

109
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,330
Forget it.

110
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,458
You will take us to the holocron.

111
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:30,128
l... l won't.

112
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:36,718
- And you will take us now!
- l... l will take you.

113
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,804
No! Get out of my head!

114
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,649
Perhaps we should try again.

115
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,611
l... l've had enough of that.

116
00:10:55,946 --> 00:11:01,201
l'll take you to the holocron.
You'll get your children back.

117
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,797
The Chancellor wants
a report on our progress.

118
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,926
Tell him this is not Republic business.
lt's an internal Jedi affair.

119
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:21,638
l'm sorry to disagree, but as long
as the Jedi are acting as a military,

120
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:26,142
we should report to the Chancellor,
even on internal matters such as this.

121
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,895
Well, then, l guess
you just volunteered to go.

122
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,939
- Give the Chancellor my regards.
- Now, wait a minute!

123
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,275
l agree.
Report back here when you are finished.

124
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,988
This could be a trap, Master.
You sure you don't need us to go?

125
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,990
Of course
it's a trap, Skywalker.

126
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,910
l will contact you
when we find the children.

127
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:48,123
- What if they don't find those kids?
- They will, Snips. Come on.

128
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:03,471
- The coordinates?
- The coordinates are

129
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:09,310
673117, cross 7RB71.

130
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,982
That will take us into the far Outer Rim.
Neutral space.

131
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:19,070
Do you want your holocron
and your kids or not?

132
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,961
- Ah, Anakin, it is good to see you.
- Your Excellency.

133
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,050
Excuse us, child.

134
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:52,437
l understand you made an important arrest
in the plot to destroy the Jedi.

135
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,816
To think a simple bounty hunter
could create such a plan.

136
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:00,779
l believe someone else, someone
much more powerful, was behind this.

137
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:05,575
- And l don't think it was Dooku.
- Oh? And have you any clues

138
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,870
- as to who it may be?
- Not yet, Chancellor.

139
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,082
Have patience, my boy.

140
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:32,769
<i>There, there, child.
Soon you will cry no more.</i>

141
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:38,650
Master, subjects of this age rarely survive
the slave conditioning procedure.

142
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,319
<i>l'm afraid the risk is necessary.</i>

143
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:47,450
<i>The natural talent these children possess
is too great to be wasted by the Jedi.</i>

144
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:55,583
<i>l foresee an army of Force-talented spies
in my service,</i>

145
00:13:55,626 --> 00:14:00,922
<i>trained in the dark side to peer
into every corner of the galaxy from afar,</i>

146
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:05,760
<i>and my enemies would be helpless
against such vision.</i>

147
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,766
<i>lf the surgery fails, l will have lost nothing.</i>

148
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,294
We'll be fine, Cody.
Stay here and watch the ship.

149
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,963
Yes, sir. l'll keep the ship running.

150
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,559
- l do not sense any children nearby.
- Neither do l.

151
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:01,316
- Where are you keeping the children?
- The children are safe.

152
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,986
But first, here is your precious holocron.

153
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:12,744
- Let me get it for you.
- No more of your tricks.

154
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,872
Blast!

155
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,541
You certainly stepped in it this time.

156
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,600
So long, Jedi!

157
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,565
Now what do we do?

158
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,832
Well, the piloting systems are clean.

159
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,794
- Checked the landing gear?
- Double-checked it.

160
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:06,589
l have the feeling Master Windu
and Obi-Wan could have used our help.

161
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,299
Look, l don't like
being out of the action either,

162
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:12,720
- but somebody's got to do this job.
- And it always ends up being us.

163
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,222
Hmm.

164
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,892
Bane picked up a lot of volcanic ash
on his travels.

165
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,104
What have you got, Artoo?

166
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:26,818
Looks like Bane erased his navigation
records, but not his fuel computer.

167
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,027
So?

168
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,488
Well, if we cross the list of planets
we know he visited

169
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,323
with the distance he traveled...

170
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:36,285
We may be able to calculate
where else he went! That's a new one.

171
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,330
lt's an old Jedi trick
we use to track down smugglers.

172
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:44,794
Okay, let's see, Glee Anselm,
Rodia, Mustafar, Naboo...

173
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:48,673
Wait. Mustafar?
There were no children on Mustafar.

174
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:52,760
lt's a mining world. Very remote.
Probably stopped there to refuel.

175
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,931
That explains the ash.
But it was six systems out of his way.

176
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,852
Maybe he met up with whoever he's
working for. lt's worth a look, isn't it?

177
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,272
Well, anything to get out of this hangar.

178
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,283
l've got the holocron!

179
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,716
Anytime, Cody.

180
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:44,145
- We're coming up on Mustafar.
- Artoo, begin the landing cycle.

181
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,702
Master, a starship is approaching.
lt is not the bounty hunter.

182
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,330
<i>This was unexpected.</i>

183
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:06,209
<i>Evacuate the children
to my secondary facility.</i>

184
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:11,964
<i>l'm afraid this installation is lost.
We must destroy all the evidence.</i>

185
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:15,802
<i>Turn off the gravity supports
and let the building sink into the lava.</i>

186
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,305
- l beg your pardon, sir?
- <i>Just do as l say!</i>

187
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:34,320
- You sure this is the right place?
- We're gonna find out.

188
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:49,043
l sense something, Master.
And l don't like it.

189
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,589
lt's the dark side, Ahsoka.
This is the right place.

190
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,015
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, l heard it.

191
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,351
Question is, where are they?

192
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,439
This way!

193
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,236
All gravity supports off.

194
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,866
Quick, the Jedi are coming!

195
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,748
Turn out the lights. Hurry, hurry.

196
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,391
- We're too late.
- l can sense they're still here.

197
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:55,568
- Be careful of the younglings!
- l know! l know!

198
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,991
- The panel's fried!
- Where's Artoo?

199
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,842
Be quiet. lt's okay.

200
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,864
The base was completely
destroyed, Master.

201
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:29,161
- And so was any clue who's behind this.
- Hmm. Most unfortunate this is.

202
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,539
We still have Bane.

203
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,460
He got away again?

204
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,213
The important thing is
that the children are safe

205
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,257
and we have recovered the holocron.

206
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:45,386
The list is intact,
and there is no evidence it was copied.

207
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:49,473
Still, the future of all Jedi uncertain is.

208
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,477
Move forward cautiously we must.
