1
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,476
<i>A royal welcome!</i>

2
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,061
<i>Sent to investigate allegations</i>

3
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,814
<i>that Mandalore was joining
Count Dooku's Separatists,</i>

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,483
<i>Obi-Wan Kenobi was reunited
with an old friend,</i>

5
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,777
<i>the Duchess Satine of Kalevala.</i>

6
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,904
<i>While Satine claimed
Mandalore's intentions</i>

7
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:35,409
<i>were to remain neutral during the war,
an attack on the capital city led Obi-Wan</i>

8
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:39,371
<i>to the discovery of a terrorist organization
known as Death Watch.</i>

9
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,290
<i>Now the Duchess travels to the Senate</i>

10
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:44,084
<i>so she can plead her case
against her involvement in the war</i>

11
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,296
<i>as the Jedi prepare a defense
against her opponents.</i>

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,797
You know your marching orders.

13
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,925
The safety of the Duchess Satine is
of the utmost importance.

14
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,343
The Death Watch will stop at nothing

15
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,555
to assassinate her
before she pleads her case to the Senate.

16
00:00:56,639 --> 00:01:00,976
The Death Watch may be backed
by the Separatists, so stay sharp.

17
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:04,313
Artoo, use your scanners to probe
for any suspicious droid activity.

18
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,358
- Anything else, sir?
- No, that will be all.

19
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,571
Yes?

20
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,907
<i>The Duchess
and her retinue requests your presence.</i>

21
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,158
Very well.

22
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,334
l sense some anxiety from you
about the Duchess.

23
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,836
- She couldn't be in safer hands.
- Yes, l know.

24
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:31,799
- Then why...
- Never mind. lt's all in the past.

25
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:36,386
- Oh, so you're close to her?
- l knew her. A long time ago.

26
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,777
All secure here.
Let's move on to the next sector.

27
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,749
War is intolerable!

28
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,545
We have been deceived into thinking
that we must be a part of it.

29
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,548
l say the moment
we committed to fighting,

30
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,550
we already lost.

31
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,717
Excuse me, Your Grace,

32
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:19,555
are you suggesting we oppose the war
on humanitarian grounds?

33
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:23,225
l'm going to oppose it
as an affront to life itself.

34
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,687
As the designated regent
of 1,500 systems,

35
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,730
l speak for thousands of worlds

36
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,151
that have urged me to allow them
to stay neutral in this war.

37
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,112
And yet some might argue
that the strongest defense

38
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,614
is a swift and decisive offense.

39
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:45,873
You are quite the general now,
aren't you, Master Kenobi?

40
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:49,918
Forgive me for interrupting,Your Highness,
l meant no disrespect.

41
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,336
Really?

42
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,088
Senators, l presume you are acquainted

43
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:58,010
with the collection of half-truths
and hyperbole known as Obi-Wan Kenobi?

44
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:02,306
- Your Highness is too kind.
- You're right. l am.

45
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:08,270
Allow me to introduce
my fellow Jedi, Anakin Skywalker.

46
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,938
Your servant, my lady.

47
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:14,943
l remember a time when Jedi were
not generals, but peacekeepers.

48
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:19,615
We are protectors, Highness.
Yours at the moment. We fight for peace.

49
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,451
What an amusing contradiction.

50
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:26,538
What Master Skywalker means is that we
are acting at the behest of Your Highness

51
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,874
to protect you from the Death Watch
and the Separatists,

52
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,918
who don't share
your neutral point of view.

53
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,878
l asked for no such thing.

54
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:36,715
That may be so,
but a majority of your court did.

55
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,888
l do not remember you
as one to hide behind excuses.

56
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:46,975
l do not remember you
as one to shrink from responsibilities.

57
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:52,648
l am certain we all agree
Duchess Satine and General Kenobi

58
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:56,318
have proven there are two sides
to every dilemma.

59
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,486
lndeed.

60
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:01,198
Now, in regard to the Senate vote,
we think...

61
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,826
l think a multitude makes discord,
not good council.

62
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,120
Right again, my lady.

63
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:11,667
There may be two sides to every dilemma,
but the Duchess only favors hers.

64
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,927
l'll check out the south quadrant.

65
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,806
- Careful over there, it's dark.
- Yeah, very funny, Mixer.

66
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,826
Stop messing around. That's not funny.

67
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,873
Droids.

68
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:59,339
A Republic military presence is the only
sure defense against the Separatists.

69
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,801
Even extremists can be reasoned with.

70
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:06,972
Perhaps, if one can be heard
over the clanking of their battle droids.

71
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:10,851
- The sarcasm of a soldier.
- The delusion of a dreamer.

72
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,980
Duchess, Master Jedi, it's been a long trip.

73
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,525
l think we could all use
a little rest and refreshment.

74
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:24,906
Hear, hear. Now let us put politics aside
until after dinner.

75
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,242
- Fine!
- Fine!

76
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,295
Stand by for lightspeed. Engage.

77
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,217
My side's secure.
What do you got, Redeye?

78
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,886
Redeye, do you copy?

79
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:06,198
- You and Satine have a history.
- An extended mission when l was younger.

80
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,909
Master Qui-Gon and l spent
a year on Mandalore,

81
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:12,746
protecting the Duchess from insurgents
who had threatened her world.

82
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,419
They sent bounty hunters after us.

83
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,547
We were always on the run,
living hand to mouth,

84
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:26,218
- never sure what the next day would bring.
- Sounds romantic.

85
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,074
A civil war killed most of Satine's people,
hence her aversion to violence.

86
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,284
When she returned,
she took on the difficult task

87
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,496
- of rebuilding her world alone.
- You didn't stay to help her?

88
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,623
That would have been problematic.

89
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,294
My duty as a Jedi
demanded l be elsewhere.

90
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,005
Demanded?

91
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,093
But it's obvious you had feelings for her.
Surely that would affect your decision.

92
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,555
Oh, it did. l live by the Jedi Code.

93
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,643
Of course. As Master Yoda says,
"A Jedi must not form attachments."

94
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:20,897
Yes. But he usually leaves out
the undercurrent of remorse.

95
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,023
Yes, Captain?

96
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,277
General, something's wrong
with Skywalker's astromech.

97
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:29,239
Scared him real good, sir.
l've also lost contact with two of my men.

98
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,408
l'm on my way down to assist you.

99
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,744
l'll go, Master. lf there's something
dangerous down there,

100
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,580
the clones and l can handle it.

101
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,379
Deep-fried nuna leg. Mmm! Delicious.

102
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,384
l beg your pardon, Senators,

103
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,596
our men are investigating
a situation belowdecks.

104
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,891
l respectfully ask you to wait here
until it is settled.

105
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,729
All right, men. What's the problem?
l'm missing dinner.

106
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:04,107
We're not sure yet, sir. But there's still
no sign of Mixer and Redeye.

107
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,401
What's the matter, buddy?

108
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,446
l know, l know. But l'm here now.

109
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,491
Use your scanners.
See if something's out of place.

110
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,257
Well, what have we here?

111
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:32,385
Looks like the contents of this box
are missing.

112
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,429
Or it got up and walked away.

113
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:38,308
All right, fan out, separate squads.
l'll contact Obi-Wan.

114
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,189
Please excuse me.

115
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,776
Anakin, what have you found?

116
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,112
<i>There's a large open container,
and the contents are missing.</i>

117
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,240
<i>And l still have two men unaccounted for.</i>

118
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:57,577
That's not good. Keep things quiet,
l'll stay with the senators.

119
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,120
Got it.

120
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,123
What's up? Did you find something?

121
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,762
There you are. Redeye, where have you
been? You've had us all worried.

122
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,099
Redeye?

123
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,336
The lift!

124
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,346
Obi-Wan!
There's assassin probes down here!

125
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,974
<i>One made it up the lift.
l'll try to hold the others here.</i>

126
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,184
Quickly! Secure the lifts!

127
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,151
Help!

128
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,578
There might be one left.

129
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,288
- Let's spread out and find it.
- Watch it!

130
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,302
- They're everywhere!
- Get behind me!

131
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,597
Get it off!

132
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,613
Do you always carry a deactivator?

133
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,618
Just because l'm a pacifist
doesn't mean l won't defend myself.

134
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,411
Now you sound like a Jedi.

135
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,005
Good work, men. You too, buddy.

136
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,261
Assassin droid.
How did that monster end up in the hold?

137
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:23,014
The question is,
who smuggled him onboard?

138
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,646
Just like that swarm of venom-mites
on Draboon, remember?

139
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,607
How could l forget? l still have the scar.

140
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,776
Begging your pardon, Duchess,

141
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,821
l distinctly remember
carrying you to safety.

142
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:41,116
l meant the scar l got
after you fell and dropped me.

143
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,784
Oh. Yes.

144
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,371
l'm looking for the droid
that services the cargo bay.

145
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:51,126
Uh, yes, sir. Are all those creatures dead?

146
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,253
That's what l'm trying to find out.

147
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,296
You're in charge
of the cargo manifest, right?

148
00:11:55,423 --> 00:12:00,343
- Uh, yes, l have it right here.
- Well, where did they come from?

149
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,347
lt is right here on the manifest.

150
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,808
"For immediate delivery to Coruscant.

151
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,768
"One container marked medical supplies."

152
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:12,647
There's no name on this chart!
There's no indication of who shipped it.

153
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,275
No, sir, just the Senate stamp,

154
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:19,279
always accepted for transport here
aboard the <i>Coronet</i>.

155
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,248
One of our four distinguished senators
appears to be a traitor.

156
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,666
l sense it, too.

157
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,839
lt looks like one of our little visitors
is still alive.

158
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,508
l have an idea how to expose the turncoat.

159
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:44,137
Return to the hull of the ship.
Destroy the last assassin droids.

160
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,890
l'll find out
which of the senators is the traitor.

161
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:55,398
- Duchess, you're not eating.
- l have no appetite.

162
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:59,235
Begging your pardon,
you must keep up your strength.

163
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,863
By all means, be my guest, Senator.

164
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:07,786
lf you insist. Ah, dessert! Excellent!

165
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,954
This morsel might prove too much

166
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,124
even for the legendary appetite
of Orn Free Taa.

167
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,877
Enjoy.

168
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,882
On second thought,
it wouldn't agree with me.

169
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,969
My theory is
our little friend will attack the Duchess

170
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,639
and anyone who defends her.

171
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:31,267
Anyone that is,
except the traitor who programmed it.

172
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,687
Take it away! Please!

173
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,816
Obi-Wan, this line of questioning
borders on torture!

174
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:48,409
l assure our pacifist Duchess
that all is under control.

175
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,912
l'm trying to expose a bigger threat.

176
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,289
lnteresting.

177
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:57,752
The droid displays unusual hostility
toward the honorable Kin Robb,

178
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:06,219
but it seems to like you, Senator Merrik.

179
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,763
Well, Prince?

180
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,600
Really, General Kenobi,

181
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,893
you're quite clever!

182
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,244
You're coming with me.

183
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:42,589
Anakin! Tal Merrik is the traitor,
and he's taken Satine hostage.

184
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,551
Copy that, but l've got
problems of my own right now.

185
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:55,894
- Cody, Rex, have you found anything?
- All quiet over here, sir.

186
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,524
Wait a minute.

187
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,416
Thanks, little guy.

188
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,502
Well, we found the little ones.
What about the mother?

189
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,670
Haven't seen it.

190
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,699
No! Please! l beg you!

191
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:56,287
- Monster! You're a horrid monster!
- Get used to it.

192
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,542
Did you find them?

193
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,253
No, but l've stationed troopers
at every escape pod.

194
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,924
Merrik will try to signal his allies for help.
We have to find him.

195
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:15,473
This may not be the time to ask,
but were you and Satine ever...

196
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:19,185
l don't see how that has any bearing
on the situation at hand.

197
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,905
- <i>Death Watch Command.</i>
- Tal Merrik here.

198
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,742
<i>Senator Merrik.
Have you completed your mission?</i>

199
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,705
Yes, sir. l have the Duchess,
but l'll need help getting her away.

200
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,417
<i>Very good.
Reinforcements are on their way.</i>

201
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,311
l'll take care of this, Obi-Wan.
You, go find your girlfriend.

202
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,856
Right. No, Anakin, she's not my...

203
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,787
Come in, Kenobi, you're expected.

204
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,916
Tal Merrik, you are under arrest.
Release the Duchess.

205
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:28,212
Hmm. l took the precaution of wiring
the ship's engines to explode.

206
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,132
l press this remote and we all die.

207
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,301
Obi, if you have any respect for me,

208
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,971
you will not take such risks
with so many people's lives at stake.

209
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,140
Satine, don't.

210
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,514
This is Merrik.

211
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:24,143
Stand by to disengage.
Say farewell, Duchess.

212
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,647
Obi-Wan, it looks like
l may never see you again.

213
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:31,526
l don't know quite how to say this,
but l've loved you

214
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,904
from the moment you came to my aid
all those years ago.

215
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,697
l don't believe this.

216
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:40,451
Satine, this is hardly
the time or place for...

217
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:48,209
All right. Had you said the word,
l would have left the Jedi Order.

218
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:52,046
That is touching. Truly it is.

219
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,383
But it's making me sick,
and we really must be going.

220
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:59,679
You have the romantic soul
of a slug, Merrik.

221
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,058
And slugs are so often trod upon.

222
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,186
lnteresting turnabout,

223
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,439
but even if l do not deliver the Duchess
alive to the Separatists,

224
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,233
l still win.

225
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:16,654
The second l'm away, l'll hit the remote
and blow the <i>Coronet</i> to bits.

226
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,614
l will not allow that.

227
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,908
What will you do? lf you shoot me,

228
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:26,247
you prove yourself a hypocrite
to every pacifist ideal you hold dear.

229
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,334
And you, Kenobi,
you are no stranger to violence.

230
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,130
You'd be hailed as a hero
by everyone on this ship.

231
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,882
Almost everyone.

232
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,761
Come on, then. Who will strike first

233
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:44,098
and brand themselves
a cold-blooded killer?

234
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,820
- Anakin...
- What? He was gonna blow up the ship.

235
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,409
Obi-Wan, l...

236
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,704
General Skywalker, the last of the droids
have been defeated, sir.

237
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,081
Very good, Cody.

238
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,628
l must get back
to the business of diplomacy.

239
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,966
As you say, Duchess, some other time.

240
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,628
A job well done, Master Jedi.

241
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,382
- Thank you, Chancellor.
- Your Excellency.

242
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:13,521
How ironic to meet again
only to find we're on opposing sides.

243
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,190
The needs of your people are
all that matter.

244
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,694
They couldn't be in better hands
with you to guide their future.

245
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:23,406
Kind words indeed
from a mindful and committed Jedi.

246
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,242
- And yet...
- What?

247
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:31,539
- l'm still not sure about the beard.
- Why? What's wrong with it?

248
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,542
lt hides too much of your handsome face.

249
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,298
What was that all about?

250
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,386
- A very remarkable woman.
- She is indeed.
