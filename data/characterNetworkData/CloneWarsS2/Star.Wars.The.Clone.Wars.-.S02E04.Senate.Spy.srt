1
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,436
<i>Treachery in the Senate!</i>

2
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,397
<i>The Jedi Council suspects
that Senator Rush Clovis</i>

3
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:27,317
<i>is secretly taking part
in a Separatist conspiracy.</i>

4
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,112
<i>But to find out
what the Senator from Scipio is up to,</i>

5
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,282
<i>the Council will need a spy of its own.</i>

6
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:37,077
<i>Meanwhile, Jedi Anakin Skywalker
has been away from Coruscant</i>

7
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,122
<i>on a lengthy tour of duty
leading the clone army.</i>

8
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,292
<i>Now Anakin returns
for a long-awaited reunion</i>

9
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,544
<i>with his wife, Padmé Amidala.</i>

10
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,505
Master Ani! What a delight to see you.

11
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,050
- l shall tell Mistress...
- Anakin!

12
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:56,472
- That will be all, Threepio.
- Are you sure, my lady?

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,976
- Yes, Threepio. Now go.
- Oh. Very well.

14
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,989
- l brought dinner.
- How did you manage this?

15
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,950
l had to hitch a ride on a cargo freighter.

16
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,495
What happened to your military transport?

17
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,997
lt blew up.

18
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,835
Anyway, the freighter captain was
bringing a shipment to a restaurant here,

19
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:30,005
and he gave me something to bring home.
We just have to...

20
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:34,510
- What?
- You called this "home."

21
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,470
What else would l call it?

22
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,138
The Naboo ambassador
gave me something.

23
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:43,060
- l think l still have it here somewhere.
- Must be something good.

24
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:48,357
lt is. lt'll be perfect.
Five-blossom bread, my specialty.

25
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,820
- You have a specialty?
- l know how to make lots of things!

26
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:57,574
When l was little, l cooked every day.
l've been saving it for a special occasion.

27
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:04,206
An evening alone with you?
l can't think of an occasion more special.

28
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,843
lnvolved with the Separatists,
the Banking Clan is.

29
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,095
Discover the truth in this matter, we must.

30
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,390
l couldn't agree more, Master Yoda.
But if Senator Amidala

31
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:25,394
has already refused to spy on
Senator Clovis of the Banking delegation,

32
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,938
l'm not sure how we can change her mind.

33
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,899
That is why we asked you
to summon young Skywalker.

34
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:35,279
l have been signaling him all night.
l don't know where he could be.

35
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,538
- l wish it could always be just like this.
- Me, too.

36
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,797
- l have to report to the Jedi Council.
- Right now?

37
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,967
Actually, about seven clicks ago.

38
00:02:57,093 --> 00:03:00,429
lf l keep delaying, Obi-Wan will send
a clone squad out to find me.

39
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,931
l've been ducking his signals all night.

40
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,934
l understand.

41
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,105
- l can sense that you're angry.
- Don't think you can read my mind.

42
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:16,320
Padmé, you shouldn't take this personally.
Duty comes first, especially in wartime.

43
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,292
Sorry l'm late. What's going on?

44
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,295
We believe Senator Clovis
is conspiring with the Separatists.

45
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,255
We need to find out what he's planning.

46
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,090
Do you want me
to interrogate him, Master?

47
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,302
No. Treat Senator Clovis as a criminal
we should not.

48
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,972
The slightest misstep could cause
a major incident.

49
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,642
You feel if we provoke him,
we'll never find out what he's up to.

50
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:50,646
Exactly. We need someone who is not
a Jedi to get close to him for us.

51
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,147
Someone he won't suspect.

52
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:55,192
- lf not a Jedi, who?
- A fellow Senator.

53
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,444
Selected Senator Amidala, we have.

54
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:01,031
You want her to spy on Clovis?
l don't think that's a good idea.

55
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,034
There has to be someone else
who's more qualified for this.

56
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,661
We chose Senator Amidala

57
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,664
because she and Clovis
entered the Senate in the same year.

58
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,333
They served on the same committees.
They were

59
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,836
- good friends.
- l didn't know that.

60
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,050
Personal matters for the Senator
these are. Know them, why would you?

61
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,678
lt's just that
l wouldn't expect Senator Amidala

62
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,471
to have a friend in the Banking Clan.

63
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:29,351
Master Yoda has already asked her
to spy on Clovis for us, and she refused.

64
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:34,731
Trust you she does, Skywalker.
That is why convince her, you must.

65
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,860
Yes, Master.

66
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,498
- Senator Amidala.
- General Skywalker.

67
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,834
You finally found some time for me.

68
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:57,879
- Are you still mad about last night?
- Why would l be mad? l'm not mad.

69
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,883
Good. Now tell me
about your dealings with Senator Clovis.

70
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,679
So, you're here on Jedi business.

71
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:11,226
l already told Master Yoda l don't want
to spy on a colleague and an old friend.

72
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,563
"Old friend"?
How well do you know Clovis?

73
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,233
Why does that matter?
That was before we were together.

74
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,908
l'm just trying
to get a sense of who this guy is.

75
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,494
l'll need to brief
whoever does end up spying on him.

76
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,373
Oh, l thought you were here to talk me
into becoming an agent for the Jedi.

77
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:38,086
That is not a job for you.
l don't agree with the Council on this.

78
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,339
lf Clovis is involved
in a Separatist conspiracy,

79
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,091
the last place you should be
is anywhere near him.

80
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:47,220
Clovis is conspiring with the Separatists?
Yoda didn't tell me that!

81
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,558
l can't believe Clovis would do that.
This is terrible.

82
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:55,520
l never expected that from him.

83
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,941
- Someone has to find out the truth.
- Someone does, just not you.

84
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,738
- Why not me?
- Because it's going to be dangerous.

85
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,449
Whoever takes this mission
will be putting their life at risk.

86
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:12,245
l've been in many tough situations before.
lt never seemed to bother you.

87
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,749
l never stopped you from facing danger.
You're constantly getting shot at...

88
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:19,753
l've been trained for that.
lt's very different from spying on a traitor.

89
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,631
You mean l can't handle the mission.

90
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,966
l mean
l'm not gonna let you do it.

91
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:30,889
You're not going to let me?
lt's not your decision to make. lt's mine.

92
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,809
Lucky for us,
you've already decided to refuse.

93
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,104
Actually, l just changed my mind.

94
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,273
You've convinced me
that it's vital to learn what Clovis is doing.

95
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:44,152
- l accept the mission to spy on him.
- Even though l'm telling you not to.

96
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:49,783
Don't take it personally, Anakin.
Duty comes first, especially in wartime.

97
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,667
First, l'll need
to get back in touch with him.

98
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,086
Clovis and l haven't spoken in a long time.

99
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,464
A surprise that is, given your past.

100
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:09,136
- What does that mean, Senator?
- At one point, Clovis and l were close.

101
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:14,015
lt was my choice to return things
to a strictly professional level.

102
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,809
Clovis didn't take it well.

103
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:19,271
Do you think you'll be able
to rekindle your friendship with him?

104
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,858
Master, Senator Clovis
is a very dangerous man.

105
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,526
lf he realizes she's trying to trick him...

106
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:29,531
l'm aware of the risks, Master Jedi,
but l know l can regain Clovis' trust.

107
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,951
Good. The closer you can get to him,
the better.

108
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:37,456
l understand. l'll do whatever is necessary
to succeed in my mission.

109
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:41,501
And l'll do whatever l have to
to protect her.

110
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,724
lt's been good to see you again, Clovis.

111
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,769
l didn't realize how lonely l was
until tonight.

112
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,314
Perhaps l can do more
to ease your loneliness

113
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,524
once l return from Cato Neimoidia.

114
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,944
- Oh, you're taking a pleasure trip?
- Hardly.

115
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:12,699
l'm going there to put the fear of Scipio in
those overgrown Trade Federation grubs.

116
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,159
You know how they are.

117
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,995
They love to borrow money
from the Banking Clan,

118
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,039
but they hate to pay it back.

119
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,583
Maybe you can say a few words
on my behalf.

120
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:25,420
l'm on the HoloNet with the Neimoidians
every day asking for trade concessions,

121
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,381
but l can't ever seem to make progress.

122
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,133
l've got an idea.

123
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:34,262
Come with me to Cato Neimoidia
and speak to them in person.

124
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:38,683
l have leverage from the Banking Clan,
you have diplomatic contacts.

125
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,393
We can help each other.

126
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,146
Are you inviting me for political reasons

127
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,733
or because you want us
to be friends again?

128
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,151
Both, of course,

129
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:52,531
although l'm far more interested
in your friendship than your politics.

130
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:59,371
ln that case, l'll be happy to go with you.
lt'll be like old times.

131
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:04,543
On the contrary.
l hope it'll be much better than old times.

132
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:15,220
- Senator Clovis.
- Padmé! You look exquisite.

133
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,812
lf you get tired,
you can rest your head on my shoulder.

134
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:29,859
Allow me, my lady.
And this one's broken. Too bad.

135
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,242
We're ready for takeoff, Captain.

136
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,828
All l have to do is fly the ship.

137
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,052
Blast it!

138
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:27,250
Senator Amidala. An unexpected privilege.

139
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:31,379
Senator Dod, please forgive me
for arriving unannounced.

140
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,924
Oh, no, always a pleasure to see you,
my dear.

141
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:41,222
- l hope you and l can make a fresh start.
- l came here with the very same hope.

142
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:46,561
- l believe in second chances.
- So do l, Senator. So do l.

143
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,527
My servants will see you to your room.

144
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,615
Clovis and l have some business
to discuss.

145
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,873
l hope you will be comfortable here.

146
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:13,129
This investment by the Banking Clan
will create unimaginable new war profits.

147
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:18,968
- The largest droid factory ever built.
- As long as the Republic doesn't find out.

148
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,138
You should never have brought
a member of the Senate here!

149
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:29,270
Threepio, after that long trip,
l think l need a walk.

150
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,814
That could prove interesting.

151
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,859
l agree, Lord Poggle.

152
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:40,198
For all the risks we're taking, we should
be getting a greater share of the profits.

153
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,209
Are you suggesting
we change the terms of our agreement?

154
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:55,714
No, a deal is a deal.
l'd hate for something to happen to you.

155
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:01,886
You forget yourself, Clovis.
You cannot threaten me on my own planet.

156
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,139
This is hardly your planet anymore,

157
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,016
not since you signed your holdings over
to the Banking Clan

158
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,395
in return for a stake
in this new droid foundry.

159
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,523
We have company. The hologram.

160
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,818
Padmé, what are you doing here?

161
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:22,949
Oh, l'm sorry to intrude. l was lonely,
so l came looking for you, and...

162
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,411
My dear, l'll give you a proper tour later.

163
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:31,166
Now let me take you back to your room
so you can get dressed for dinner.

164
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,501
Now if you'll excuse me,

165
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,005
l'll see you at dinner.

166
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:46,389
How do you think l feel?
l hate the thought of answering to Clovis.

167
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:53,354
But perhaps we won't have to,
now that we've finally found his weakness.

168
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:57,901
What if we were
to poison Senator Amidala?

169
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,070
l think Clovis would do anything
to save her,

170
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,740
and only we would have the antidote.

171
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,917
No, thanks, Artoo. l'm not hungry.

172
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,085
As soon as Senator Amidala
finds something,

173
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,546
she's gonna signal me to come inside.

174
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:39,400
Senator, as my honored guest,
please share this drink with me.

175
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,743
A toast to our new friendship.

176
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,914
Of course.

177
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,589
Come, Senator,
everyone is eager to meet you.

178
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,600
What a wonderful meal.
My compliments to the droid.

179
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,275
Are you feeling all right?

180
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:28,449
- l'm fine. l stood up too fast.
- lt has been a very long day.

181
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,619
Perhaps we should retire
to the guest quarters.

182
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:35,790
Unless you'd like a tour of the palace.
lt's truly worth seeing.

183
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,293
A tour sounds perfect.

184
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,129
You're dismissed for the night.

185
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:45,800
- Are you absolutely sure?
- Yes, l'm sure.

186
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:56,811
Well, really! My services not required
for the rest of the evening.

187
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,813
Why isn't Padmé with you?

188
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:03,067
She is with Senator Clovis.
He offered her a private tour of the palace.

189
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,946
- And you let her go off with him?
- l did try to warn her.

190
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,286
l'm waiting
for my business venture to start.

191
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:17,165
l'm doing some private investing
with guaranteed returns.

192
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,001
Could you bring me something to drink?

193
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:23,504
l'm so thirsty all of a sudden,
and my head is pounding.

194
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,384
Oh, you poor thing. lt's the climate change.
l'll be right back.

195
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:44,233
- Display hologram.
- <i>Passcode required.</i>

196
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:50,198
"Scipio." "Banking Clan."
"Senator Clovis."

197
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,368
"Baron Rush Clovis." "Rush."

198
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:59,207
- "Padmé"?
- <i>Passcode accepted.</i>

199
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:04,212
Tactical coordinates
for Count Dooku's new droid foundry.

200
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,673
And Clovis and the Banking Clan
are behind it.

201
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:10,176
The Jedi Council has to see this evidence.

202
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,555
Finally! Gotta go!

203
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,226
lt seems no one
wants my company tonight.

204
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,273
Still dying of thirst?

205
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:37,704
Ah! That tastes so good.
l guess l was just thirsty.

206
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,623
Come, Padmé. Give me your hand.

207
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:49,382
You're so good to me, Clovis.
l don't deserve your kindness.

208
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,260
lt's nice to hear you say that.

209
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,309
l've been waiting for this moment all night.

210
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:09,318
- Your heart is racing.
- Because of you.

211
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:13,573
l wasn't sure you still had feelings for me,
but now...

212
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,619
l would have said something earlier,

213
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,206
but we were
in the middle of our official duties,

214
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,877
and duty comes first, no matter...

215
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,964
- No matter how we feel.
- Padmé, what's wrong?

216
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,469
Take good care of this, Artoo.

217
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,805
Get the ship ready for takeoff.

218
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:44,062
Stay with her. l'll go get a medical droid.

219
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:48,483
An excellent idea. l'm afraid this situation
is quite beyond my capacity.

220
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,904
lf l'm not here in five minutes,
leave without me.

221
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:56,574
No matter what happens,
the Council has to see this hologram.

222
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,952
l know her symptoms.
She's been poisoned.

223
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,288
- What do you mean?
- She could die.

224
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:06,793
Get a hold of yourself, Senator.
She is a Republic spy!

225
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,504
What? No!

226
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,015
Passcode "Padmé."

227
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,351
<i>No hologram is available.</i>

228
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,230
She did steal it!

229
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,693
Leave us.

230
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:39,242
l was just in the library.
The hologram disk is gone.

231
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:45,164
l see now why you renewed our friendship,
so you could spy on me and steal from me.

232
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,875
l did it for the Republic.

233
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:51,712
l didn't want to believe that you were
involved with the Separatists,

234
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,882
but you are. You're a traitor!

235
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,884
Where is the disk you stole?

236
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:01,514
lt's on its way to the Senate.
Your scheme is finished!

237
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,184
Get away from her if you wanna live.

238
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,397
Padmé!

239
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,441
How dare you speak like that to me?
l'm a Senator!

240
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:17,530
- What's wrong with her?
- Lott Dod poisoned her. She's dying.

241
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,825
l'll take her to the doctors on Coruscant.

242
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:24,370
There's not enough time for that.
Lott Dod must have an antidote.

243
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,915
She's stolen a very valuable disk from me.

244
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,252
Return it
and l'll get the antidote from Lott Dod.

245
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,088
l prefer to negotiate
with Lott Dod in person.

246
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:38,384
- No! He cannot be told...
- What? That you lost the disk?

247
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:43,222
l'm sure he'd be very interested
in hearing all about this.

248
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:49,103
He might kill me if he finds out.
But still, it's her life that l worry about.

249
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,064
She must be saved, because l love her.

250
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:56,444
ln that case, l suggest you help us
back to the Senator's ship

251
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,529
before Lott Dod finds anything out.

252
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,907
Come with me! Quickly!

253
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,627
We must make haste.

254
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,922
What is going on, Clovis?

255
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:23,429
l'm sorry, Lott, Senator Amidala is very ill
and we're taking her to her ship.

256
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:27,475
lf Senator Amidala is ill,
she should not be moved.

257
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,978
l have contacted the authorities on Naboo.

258
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,439
They thought it best
to take her back to Coruscant.

259
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:37,068
- The doctors there are better equipped.
- You cannot leave!

260
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:42,782
- Give me the antidote or you're dead!
- You'll pay for this.

261
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,826
Give Clovis the antidote.

262
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,750
Your kindness
is much appreciated, Senator.

263
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,710
Take her, quickly!

264
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,048
Have you lost your mind?

265
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,264
Wait! Give me back my disk!

266
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:11,060
Don't worry, Clovis.
lt's good to know you have a heart.

267
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,812
l wish l could give you the disk,

268
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,314
but l have a lot of faith
in your survival skills.

269
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,778
Where's that medicine, Threepio?

270
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,750
l'm sorry.

271
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,838
What for?
We got away and we have the hologram.

272
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:43,259
The Jedi will use that information
to destroy Count Dooku's foundry.

273
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:47,263
- Your mission was a success.
- But l made you doubt me.

274
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,390
Never.

275
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,643
Clovis, we need to talk.
