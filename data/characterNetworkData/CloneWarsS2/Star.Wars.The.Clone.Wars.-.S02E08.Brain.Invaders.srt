1
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,644
<i>Victory on Geonosis!</i>

2
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:25,232
<i>After a massive assault, the Republic has
finally recaptured the Separatist planet</i>

3
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:28,527
<i>and shut down its droid factories of doom.</i>

4
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:33,782
<i>An investigation by Luminara Unduli led to
the discovery of Queen Karina the Great,</i>

5
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:38,120
<i>whose hive mind
could reanimate dead Geonosian soldiers.</i>

6
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,456
<i>During the destruction
of the Queen's temple,</i>

7
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,792
<i>the Jedi apprehended
her advisor, Poggle the Lesser,</i>

8
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,963
<i>and now prepare to deliver the villain
to Coruscant for trial.</i>

9
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,933
- l'm afraid we have a complication.
- Don't we always?

10
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:03,437
l've just received a distress signal
from our forces on Dantooine.

11
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,232
Master Windu's defenses held,
but at a great cost to his men.

12
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,401
They need medical supplies immediately.

13
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,821
We can obtain these supplies at
the medical station near Ord Cestus.

14
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:17,451
We're delivering Poggle to Coruscant,
and Cestus is not exactly on the way.

15
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,245
The Republic must begin
debriefing Poggle right away

16
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,748
if we're to get useful intelligence from him.

17
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:27,169
Master, l suggest we let our Padawans
handle the supply mission.

18
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:30,464
Whatever needs to be done, Master,
l'm happy to help.

19
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:34,009
- As am l.
- Very well. Take a medical frigate.

20
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,969
And after we've delivered Poggle
to Coruscant,

21
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,847
we'll rendezvous with you
for the voyage to Dantooine.

22
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:15,551
Sorry, boys. Hope l didn't interrupt
any pleasant dreams.

23
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,678
We got another mission, sir?

24
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,057
You bet. We're making
a medical supply run to Ord Cestus.

25
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:26,520
Thought we were bred
for battle, not running errands.

26
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:30,399
Hey! We were bred
to follow orders, Pulsar.

27
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,693
You got a problem with that?

28
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:37,406
- No, sir. No problem.
- That's what l thought. Now, move!

29
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:46,582
Scythe, come on.
Up, brother, up and at 'em.

30
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,927
Hey, Scythe.
Welcome back to the land of the living.

31
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,972
Thank you, sir.

32
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,956
We are ready to make ourjump,
Master Fisto.

33
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,334
<i>Good. l look forward to your arrival.</i>

34
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,945
What? What is it?

35
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:03,408
lt's too quiet. lt's a big change
from all the fighting the last few days.

36
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:08,664
- You should enjoy this peace while it lasts.
- l can't. Let's go eat.

37
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,555
l was just thinking
about what you said earlier,

38
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,641
about enjoying the peace while it lasts.

39
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,061
As a Jedi,
l'm not sure l know how to do that.

40
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:17,149
Master Windu has said we are
keepers of the peace, not warriors.

41
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:21,236
However, once the war is over,
it will be ourjob to maintain the peace.

42
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,741
Yes, but will we do so
as keepers of the peace or warriors?

43
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,161
And what's the difference?

44
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:32,497
l don't have all the answers, Ahsoka.
Like you, l am a learner.

45
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:37,544
- What does your Master tell you?
- Anakin? Oh, um...

46
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,091
You might find some of his thoughts
on the future a bit radical.

47
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,760
Really? Why?

48
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:48,930
Let's just say my Master
will always do what needs to be done.

49
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,933
l'm not even sure
how peacetime will agree with him.

50
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,400
Just came up to check on us, Scythe?

51
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,404
Well, we're on course,
and all systems are green.

52
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,449
What the...

53
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,829
We have control of the bridge.

54
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,627
Evening, Ox, Edge.
Would you like to join us?

55
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,924
ls something wrong,
troopers?

56
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,432
Troopers! Stand down!

57
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,153
What are you doing?

58
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,281
Two clones just attacked us.
What is going on?

59
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,659
Trap, do you know
what happened to those troopers?

60
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,328
Couldn't tell you, Commander.
l'm just as confused as...

61
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,540
You're in charge of those men!
Did you order them to kill us?

62
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,667
No, sir! l did not.

63
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,003
What's happening?
Why would they do this?

64
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,297
We don't know. We heard shots.

65
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,966
Why should we believe you?

66
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,218
Look, no guns.

67
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,603
These men wouldn't just attack us
without reason.

68
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:23,191
My Master had a clone betray them once,
a traitor who was paid off by Ventress.

69
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:27,696
lt can't be that simple.
At least, it didn't feel like that.

70
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:31,491
Excuse me, sir, we should make sure
that we're still in control of the bridge.

71
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,244
Bridge, this is Barriss. Respond.

72
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,372
We need to get up there.
We need to find out what's going on.

73
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,708
But these two
will be coming around any minute.

74
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,043
Havoc can watch them
until we check on the bridge.

75
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,712
Okay. Let's go.

76
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,934
The cargo ship failed
to check in on schedule.

77
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,062
l attempted to contact them.
There is no reply.

78
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,690
l don't like it. Something's up.

79
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,569
lt is certainly most unlike either Padawan
to lose contact.

80
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,740
- They're in trouble.
- Anakin, have faith in your Padawan.

81
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,241
She would have checked in.

82
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,744
- Like you always do?
- Good point.

83
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,080
Sometimes l don't think you realize
how alike you two have become.

84
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:22,751
We need to continue
our interrogation of Poggle.

85
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:26,421
Yes, agreed.
He's being most uncooperative.

86
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,762
- Keep your ears open in case Ahsoka calls.
- Got it.

87
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,733
Engage the autopilot
and put up the security shields.

88
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,822
Someone doesn't want us going up there.

89
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,617
l'll attempt to override the controls.

90
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,833
He's infected!

91
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,421
Get this thing off me!

92
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,429
What is that?

93
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:20,600
Looks like some type of parasite.
lt must be controlling their actions.

94
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:24,354
Mind control.
Well, that explains a lot.

95
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,857
Trap was my friend.
He would never have tried to kill us.

96
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,486
How did these things get on board
in the first place?

97
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,031
They must have infected the clones
while they were on Geonosis.

98
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,700
We'll have to quarantine the ship.

99
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:40,829
We should also contact Master Fisto
and let him know about the situation.

100
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,205
Let's go.

101
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,671
- That sound. lt's...
- Geonosian.

102
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,394
We have to help him.

103
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,067
lt's too late.

104
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,098
Barriss! Let's go for the vent!

105
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,618
l'll go to the reactor room
and disable the thrusters.

106
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,913
You head for the aft comm center
and send a warning to Master Fisto.

107
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,248
We have to stop the ship
from reaching the medical station.

108
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,923
l don't know, Barriss.
l think we should stay together.

109
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,968
As do l. Unfortunately,
that's not a luxury we have right now.

110
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,970
One of us must succeed, Ahsoka.

111
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,766
lf you need to, you'll do
what must be done. l know it.

112
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,977
Yes. Of course. Then l'll see you soon.

113
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:39,489
<i>As long as these things are on board,
we dare not dock with the medical station.</i>

114
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,449
You must bring the ship in.

115
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,661
The only way we can stop these parasites
is to analyze them.

116
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:48,623
<i>You don't understand how terrible
these things are. What if they get loose?</i>

117
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,625
We will take precautions.

118
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:54,462
l have a bad feeling about this,
Master Fisto,

119
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,840
but l will follow your instructions.

120
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:22,991
lf there's one thing we clones know,
it's how to stop a Jedi.

121
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,207
NO!

122
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,379
Almost got it.

123
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,301
<i>Cargo ship TB-73, this is
Clone Captain Rex. Please respond.</i>

124
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,680
Rex, this is Ahsoka.
Boy, am l glad to hear your voice.

125
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,893
<i>Likewise, sir. l've got someone here
who wants to speak with you.</i>

126
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,853
<i>Ahsoka, what's going on? Are you okay?</i>

127
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:55,148
Well, not exactly.

128
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,911
<i>Make sure you have a wrist com.
Keep it on.</i>

129
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,747
<i>l'm going to interrogate Poggle.
He might have some answers.</i>

130
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,208
<i>Find Barriss and wait for my signal.</i>

131
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,672
Barriss, you're back. Were you successful?

132
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,637
Barriss? What's wrong?

133
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,556
Barriss, no!

134
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:37,148
l'm your friend! Barriss, snap out of it!

135
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:50,078
Barriss, it's not you, it's the creatures!
Fight them!

136
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,097
Leave us.

137
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,060
You will answer my questions.

138
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,314
Your feeble Jedi mind tricks

139
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,068
do not work on Geonosians.
The other Jedi already learned this.

140
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,990
Mind tricks?

141
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,621
l don't need mind tricks to get you to talk.

142
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:41,254
- l will never talk, Jedi.
- We'll see about that, Poggle.

143
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,672
- l made contact with Ahsoka.
- What's their status?

144
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,175
Geonosian parasites
have infected her crew.

145
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,801
How did they get on board her ship?

146
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,845
Poggle said the parasites
must have needed a new host

147
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,639
after we raided the Queen's temple.

148
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,349
You interrogated Poggle?

149
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,353
l did. There wasn't time
to get the rest of you.

150
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,147
How did you get him to talk?

151
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,275
Look, all that matters is that
he told me how to stop the worms.

152
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,201
This is Ahsoka. Come in.

153
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:57,705
<i>Ahsoka, listen to me.
The worms are affected by the cold!</i>

154
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,458
Cold? That's how we stop them?

155
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,418
<i>Rupture the coolant system.</i>

156
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:09,425
<i>Did you hear me?
Rupture the coolant system!</i>

157
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,302
The coolant system. Got it.

158
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,516
That's Ahsoka's ship.
lt just came out of hyperspace.

159
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,268
Send out the tugs to help guide them in.

160
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,150
Warn all medical hazard crew

161
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:11,362
that l don't want anyone boarding
that ship until the parasites are contained.

162
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,574
Sound all the alarms.
And prepare the sub-zero conduits.

163
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,835
Engage tractor beam.

164
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,267
There you are.
You can't hide from me.

165
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,658
The bridge. At last.

166
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,336
We're coming in awfully fast.
This is Ahsoka Tano, can you hear me?

167
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,588
l'm shutting down the engines.
l'll try to reverse the...

168
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,013
l'm having a hard time slowing her down.

169
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,432
There's no one at the controls!
The pilot must be dead!

170
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,269
- Sir, she's listing.
- The escort ships must maintain control.

171
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,241
Kill me. Please.

172
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,701
l can't.

173
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,228
Full power! Now! Now!

174
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,364
We got her. We got her!
Attach the sub-zero conduits.

175
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,742
- The temperature is below freezing, sir.
- Let's board, then.

176
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,079
But stay on guard.
They may still be dangerous.

177
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,933
Hello, Master Fisto.

178
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,437
We're ready to pick up the supplies.

179
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:54,025
We'll take care of that.
You rest now, Ahsoka.

180
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,535
lt's all right, Ahsoka. lt's okay. You're safe.

181
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,996
Barriss?

182
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:11,709
Barriss is fine, thanks to your efforts.

183
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,461
And so are the clones.

184
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:18,633
- What were those things?
- l think l can help answer that.

185
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,220
We had the parasite worms analyzed.

186
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:26,557
They are the same type of creature
you found on Geonosis, Master Skywalker.

187
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,101
We'll have to inform the troops
on Geonosis.

188
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,772
This parasite might explain how
they recaptured the planet the first time.

189
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,815
l don't want it happening again.

190
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,401
You've been through quite an ordeal,
little one.

191
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,488
Master Skywalker, may l have a word?

192
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,330
Master, on the ship, Barriss was

193
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,499
gone,

194
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,377
and she wanted me to kill her.

195
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,630
- She told me...
- But you couldn't do it.

196
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:02,677
No. No, l couldn't. But should l have?

197
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:07,014
l mean, it worked out now,
but if we had failed,

198
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,017
if the ship docked
and the worms spread and...

199
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:14,355
Ahsoka, it's your duty
to save as many lives as you can.

200
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,441
Barriss knew you could save thousands
if the worms were destroyed.

201
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,611
Which she thought
meant destroying her, too.

202
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,947
But you did the right thing.

203
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,992
You knew the freezing cold
would kill the worms.

204
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:31,622
Letting go of our attachments
is a difficult struggle for all of us.

205
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,083
You followed your instincts.

206
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,711
l'm sure she would agree
that you made the right choice.
