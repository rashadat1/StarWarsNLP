1
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,269
<i>The final surge!</i>

2
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,604
<i>Having learned
of warlord Poggle the Lesser's plot</i>

3
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,774
<i>to rebuild a Separatist droid foundry
on Geonosis,</i>

4
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:29,153
<i>Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker
and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano,</i>

5
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,239
<i>prepare to assault
this heavily fortified installation.</i>

6
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:36,410
<i>Their mission,
destroy the factory at all cost.</i>

7
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,328
<i>Anticipating stiff resistance,</i>

8
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,457
<i>Republic commanders send
Jedi Master Luminara Unduli</i>

9
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:45,169
<i>and her Padawan, Barriss Offee,
to reinforce the attack.</i>

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,005
<i>But time runs short for our intrepid heroes</i>

11
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,591
<i>as the dreaded droid mill
nears completion.</i>

12
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:57,681
Captain, the only safe landing zone
is south of Skywalker's position.

13
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:58,932
Yes, General.

14
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:04,146
Barriss, l assume
you've made the necessary preparations.

15
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,523
Precisely as you instructed, Master.

16
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,486
Buckle your belts and
check your cells, soldiers. We're going in.

17
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,376
This bridge is our first waypoint.

18
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:30,047
Focus your fire on the gun emplacements,
here and here, because it's only...

19
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,174
Because it's only
after we neutralize the guns

20
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,177
- that we can push for the factory.
- l was...

21
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,181
Yes, we can push for the factory.
Now, expect stiff resistance from...

22
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,726
And don't forget to top off
your energy cells and ration packs.

23
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:46,522
Once we leave, there'll be no resupply.
Anything else, Ahsoka?

24
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,858
No. l think you've pretty much
covered everything

25
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,527
in my briefing.

26
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,029
Very well. Squad dismissed.

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,034
Okay. What's next?

28
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,745
You know, Master,
my briefings might go better

29
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,873
if you didn't interrupt me
every time l tried to...

30
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,042
l wasn't interrupting.
l was trying to help you.

31
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:11,797
Which l would appreciate,
if you didn't interrupt me to do it.

32
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,550
l just think maybe you don't trust me
to give the briefing.

33
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,469
lt's not about trust.
lt's about getting the job done right.

34
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,681
So you don't trust me
to get the job done right! l knew it!

35
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:25,144
- Snips, l never said...
- No. No, it's okay. l understand.

36
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,771
l'm the Padawan, you're the Master.

37
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,905
Good day, General.
Skywalker's waiting for you.

38
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,411
- At it again, are they?
- Again, Master?

39
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:45,664
Let's just say that they have a penchant
for playing loose

40
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,250
- with regulations and rules of command.
- Yeah, but when l say it,

41
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,335
- they actually listen to me.
- Well, if you don't trust me,

42
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,339
- then maybe you should send me back.
- Don't tempt me, Snips.

43
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,092
lf you're both finished
with your little discussion,

44
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,344
we do have a factory to destroy.

45
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,974
Well, Barriss?
Aren't you going to introduce yourself?

46
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,269
Padawan learner Barriss Offee
at your service.

47
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:14,109
Glad to meet you. l'm Ahsoka.

48
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,614
lt's good to see both of you again.

49
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,284
l wish it was
under more peaceful circumstances.

50
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,463
A frontal assault is risky.
Our losses will be high.

51
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,174
But not as high as they'll be
if that factory comes online.

52
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,885
lndeed, but there is an alternative.

53
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,639
Every Geonosian building has a series
of catacombs beneath it

54
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,140
that run deep underground.

55
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,310
Some of the tunnels are close enough
to this cliff wall

56
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,021
so that you could cut a hole
and make an entry point.

57
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,482
Once inside,
we could find the main reactor,

58
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,652
plant the explosives
and blow the factory inside out.

59
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,488
Well, looks like a good way to get lost,
if you ask me.

60
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,323
For the unprepared, perhaps.

61
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:05,994
But l have instructed Barriss to memorize
the labyrinth, all 200 junctions.

62
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,330
You always were thorough.

63
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,375
lt pays for one to be prepared.
Right, Barriss?

64
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,503
Especially when other people's lives
depend on your success.

65
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:19,091
How do we keep the Geonosians occupied
while someone else is setting the bombs?

66
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,803
Good point, Snips. lf whoever is going
in there is going to be successful,

67
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,179
we'll need to create a diversion.

68
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,558
Precisely. That task will be carried out
by you and l, Skywalker,

69
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,770
while the destruction of the factory
falls to the Padawans.

70
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:35,941
Now, hold on. Who decided that?
Walking into that factory could be suicide.

71
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,403
Not if you and l are successful
holding Poggle's attention at the bridge.

72
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:43,282
Master, l can do this!
l've had riskier assignments.

73
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,576
But unlike Barriss,
you aren't prepared for this mission.

74
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:51,623
Not to worry, my Padawan is reliable.
She can lead them both through the maze.

75
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,500
We'll be in and out, Master.

76
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:57,045
See? Dependable Barriss
will get us through.

77
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,258
Don't worry, Master.
As you well know, l can follow orders.

78
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,302
lt's decided, then.

79
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,013
l guess it is.

80
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,182
We'll monitor your progress
on these chronometers.

81
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:13,729
Synchronize on my mark. Three, two, one,

82
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,732
mark.

83
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,110
Let's get going. After you, Barriss.

84
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,246
You feel Ahsoka is not up to the task?

85
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,166
- l never said that.
- What is it, then?

86
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,627
Nothing. Let's prepare the men.

87
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:45,093
We'll have to make a bold move
if we're to draw them out of the factory

88
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,472
and keep their attention on us
and not the Padawans.

89
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,266
The best way to do that is to
march our troops straight up the middle,

90
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,769
parade style. They can't resist that.

91
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:57,606
- With no cover?
- Well, we have to make it tempting.

92
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,780
The factory is operating
at 50% production capacity.

93
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,949
We have 10 garrisons of new droids
ready to deploy.

94
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,121
No, the Super Tanks are not ready,

95
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,124
but when they are,
the Republic forces will be routed.

96
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,960
They have no weapon
that can penetrate its heavy armor.

97
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:35,185
Here come the droids. Everybody steady.
Steady. Keep marching.

98
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,939
l hope the Padawans have made it
past the bridge by now.

99
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:55,831
- That looks like a lot of droids.
- Well, it is a droid factory.

100
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,000
As long as we can destroy them
faster than they can make them,

101
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,460
we'll come out on top.

102
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,338
l love
your simple logic, Skywalker.

103
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,506
Here we go!

104
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,141
<i>Let them fall into the trap.</i>

105
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,529
<i>You may now commence attack.</i>

106
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:09,571
- Nice work. Well, here goes nothing.
- l should go in first. l know the way.

107
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,073
Be my guest.

108
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,322
- They're sleeping.
- We have to find another way.

109
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,283
We don't have time.
This direction is the fastest.

110
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,911
- Maybe you're wrong.
- Trust me.

111
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,343
Ahsoka. Ahsoka!

112
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,418
They should have entered the catacombs
by now.

113
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,378
l sure hope they're not lost down there.

114
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,382
Left at the next junction.

115
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,763
- Dead end.
- lf we make a wrong turn,

116
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:03,101
we may never find our way out.
You do remember the way, don't you?

117
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,478
Of course l do.

118
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,525
lt's not left. lt's up.

119
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,403
lt's this way.

120
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,548
- Rex! A little help here.
- Get up there, trooper!

121
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:50,398
My lord, l beg you
to let us use the secret weapons.

122
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:56,529
We have 20 units ready now
and many more on the way.

123
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,409
Thank you, my lord.

124
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,330
Deploy the Super Tanks. Attack formation.

125
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,845
- Looks like the Separatists have a new toy.
- Rex, pick your targets.

126
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,473
Yes, sir. Elevation 427.

127
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,612
Whoa! That's a lot of droids.

128
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,700
Come on.
The main control room is this way.

129
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:51,084
Steady. Steady. Fire!

130
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,142
Our shields are holding.
They can't touch us.

131
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,601
That's a relief.

132
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,483
- Sir, nothing could withstand that.
- They must be ray-shielded.

133
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,321
This is it. We're here.

134
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,087
Two Jedi in the control room?
That is impossible.

135
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,964
How could they have gotten past security?

136
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,846
And now, we make ourselves scarce.

137
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,401
Green light. The bombs are active!

138
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,613
- The Padawans did it.
- And just in time!

139
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,033
Fire!

140
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:07,869
Get down!

141
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,555
You heard His Highness.

142
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,767
Collect their pathetic little bombs,
then we will kill them.

143
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,779
See if your stupid tank can take this.

144
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,490
Fool.

145
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,450
The Super Tank is impervious
to all weapons.

146
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,435
Rex! Tell the men to fall back!

147
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,814
But, sir, you can't be asking us
to turn tail and run!

148
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,774
l'm not asking you to run, Rex.

149
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,652
l wanna draw those tanks out
onto the bridge.

150
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:27,782
- l see what you have in mind.
- l always come prepared, Master. Let's go!

151
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,455
The bombs!

152
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,802
Stupid green bugger!

153
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,156
Fall back! Fall back!

154
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,067
Give everything you've got.

155
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,216
- Uh-oh.
- Roger, roger.

156
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,734
Where are they? Those bombs
are gonna go off any second now.

157
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,696
Rex, any sign ofAhsoka or Barriss
on your side?

158
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,740
No, sir.
But this place is getting ready to blow.

159
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,868
The evacuation ships are arriving.
l suggest you get on one.

160
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,914
- Not without Ahsoka.
- My Padawan will not fail.

161
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,292
Ahsoka, can you hear me?
Ahsoka, where are you?

162
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,932
Where did she go?

163
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,320
- The bugs took the bombs.
- What are we gonna do now?

164
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,990
l don't know what to do
without the bombs.

165
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,119
Well, this tank could destroy
the power generator,

166
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:24,125
- and probably us along with it.
- l guess that's our only choice.

167
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,961
Master, can you hear me?

168
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,758
- <i>Master!</i>
- Ahsoka, set off the bombs! We're trapped!

169
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:36,137
- l'm sorry, Master. We can't make it out.
- <i>Can't make it out?</i>

170
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,681
- <i>Ahsoka, wait!</i>
- Fire!

171
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,454
Get down! Get down!

172
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,510
Ahsoka.

173
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,929
Ahsoka! Can you hear me? Come in!

174
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:23,559
- Master Luminara, don't worry.
- Be at ease, Skywalker.

175
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,354
At ease? We need to act now!

176
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:29,232
Ahsoka and Barriss may still be alive
down there.

177
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,819
There's not enough time.
l sense them drifting away.

178
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,488
No. We'll get them out.

179
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,165
The tank lifters are here to move
the debris as ordered, General.

180
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,875
Get to it, Rex.

181
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:01,055
- How deep do you think we're buried?
- lt's probably best not to think about it.

182
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,225
Hand me that power cell, would you?

183
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:11,232
- Thanks. Mind holding the light?
- Whatever you're doing, l hope it works,

184
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:15,987
because l'd sure rather have died fighting
up there than starve to death down here.

185
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:19,615
Don't worry, we'll run out of air
long before we starve.

186
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,702
That's a comforting thought. Thanks.

187
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,705
Master Skywalker has taught me
a trick or two.

188
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:29,167
l think l can get
this communicator working.

189
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,551
We cannot abandon our Padawans.

190
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,555
You misjudge me.
l, too, care for my apprentice.

191
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:47,268
- But if their time has come...
- l refuse to let Ahsoka die.

192
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,020
She will find a way out.

193
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,274
lf my Padawan has perished,
l will mourn her,

194
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,068
but l will celebrate her as well
through her memory.

195
00:19:56,361 --> 00:20:00,656
Well, l still plan on celebrating this victory
with my Padawan, in person.

196
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,453
What happens to us now doesn't matter.
By destroying this factory,

197
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:11,459
- we've saved countless lives elsewhere.
- Well, l'm about to save two more.

198
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,302
Wait. l'm picking up a pulse
on Ahsoka's comm channel.

199
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,054
lt's coming from over there.

200
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:28,601
Master, l know you're up there,
and l know you're looking for me.

201
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,738
- l'll move the heavy machinery over, sir.
- No time!

202
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,252
Someone's digging!

203
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,977
- Barriss!
- Ahsoka!

204
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,025
l knew they were still alive.
l told you we shouldn't give up on them.

205
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,152
lt's not that l gave up, Skywalker,

206
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:25,616
but unlike you, when the time comes,
l am prepared to let my student go.

207
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,702
Can you say the same?

208
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:36,460
- l knew you'd come looking for me.
- l never doubted you for a second.

209
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,506
- Padawan, you did well.
- Thank you, Master.

210
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,384
But if it weren't for Ahsoka,
we'd still be down there.

211
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:48,723
lndeed.
Your Master never lost faith in you.
