1
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,310
<i>A calculated risk!</i>

2
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,272
<i>Following a costly victory
on the planet Malastare,</i>

3
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:27,609
<i>Chancellor Palpatine orders Jedi Knights
Mace Windu and Anakin Skywalker</i>

4
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,946
<i>to transport a fearsome Zillo Beast
captured during the battle</i>

5
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,781
<i>back to Coruscant.</i>

6
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:36,326
<i>After seeing that not even a lightsaber
could harm the Beast,</i>

7
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:40,122
<i>Chancellor Palpatine hopes to unlock
the secret of its invulnerability</i>

8
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,542
<i>to create new armor
for the Republic's clone troopers.</i>

9
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:47,755
<i>Tensions run high as the most
dangerous life form in the galaxy</i>

10
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:51,341
<i>touches down
on the Republic's most populous planet.</i>

11
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,849
Let's go! Move it! Move it!

12
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,435
Come on. Come on! l can see him.

13
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,312
Stand your ground.

14
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,990
Watch it! Watch it!

15
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,871
- You are clear. You are clear.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

16
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,549
- No, no, don't stop.
- Yes, sir.

17
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,229
Your Excellency.

18
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,400
Such size, such power.

19
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,362
With respect, Chancellor,

20
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,365
l believe this creature could pose
any number of dangers.

21
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,368
Bringing it here to Coruscant is a mistake.

22
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:03,580
l assure you l did not make this decision
lightly, Master Jedi.

23
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,251
The sooner we unlock
the Zillo Beast's secrets,

24
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,003
the sooner we can end this terrible war.

25
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,005
l hope you're right, Chancellor.

26
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,433
l'm turning the Zillo Beast
over to you, Doctor.

27
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,103
l trust it will be given good care.

28
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,231
The Beast is a priceless resource,
Master Windu.

29
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:32,067
lt will be well treated, l assure you.

30
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,267
Why would the Chancellor
want to bring the Beast here?

31
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:08,353
l know that he thinks by studying it,
the knowledge could prove beneficial,

32
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,772
but from what you and Anakin
reported on Malastare,

33
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,858
it hardly seems worth the effort.

34
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:16,445
l raised the issue with the Chancellor
during the Battle of Malastare,

35
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,113
without success.

36
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,994
Well then, in that case,
perhaps it's time we let someone else try.

37
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,068
That's enough.

38
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:11,667
lts scales are remarkably strong and light.
lf we could examine their composition,

39
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:16,338
we might be able to synthesize them
to reinforce our clone armor.

40
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:20,759
- And what is stopping you?
- We need to remove the scales first.

41
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,429
lt's very difficult, not to mention painful.

42
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,350
Would it not be more efficient
to simply kill the Beast?

43
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,395
Kill it? Are you sure?

44
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,189
Chancellor, l must protest.

45
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:39,069
Besides being the last of its kind,
this creature may be intelligent.

46
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,031
l find that hard to believe.
lt is, after all, just an animal.

47
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,576
lt didn't seem to like your comment.

48
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,248
l applaud your high moral stance, Doctor.

49
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,751
After all,
principle is in short supply these days.

50
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:59,047
However, every passing minute of warfare
brings countless deaths,

51
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:03,302
deaths that could be prevented
once the Beast's secrets are unlocked.

52
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:08,098
lf there is any way to hasten that process,
it is our moral duty to explore it.

53
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:13,937
l serve at your pleasure, Chancellor.
l'm just not sure where to begin.

54
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,357
The fact remains
that the Beast is indestructible.

55
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,777
Nothing is truly indestructible, Doctor.

56
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:25,157
Wasn't there something in Malastare fuel
that affected the Beast?

57
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,702
- lt weakened the Zillo, yes, but...
- Excellent.

58
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,996
l suggest you start there.

59
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,916
Doctor, you need to find a way
to kill that Beast,

60
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,837
or we shall replace you
with someone who can.

61
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:13,121
Oh, hello!
You're not in trouble again, are you?

62
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,041
l am not being rude.

63
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,835
Not that it isn't a pleasure, Senator,

64
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,880
but l thought l was just meeting
Obi-Wan here.

65
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,050
Master Kenobi explained the problem.
l'm here to help.

66
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,136
Problem? What problem?

67
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,557
The situation with our friend
from Malastare.

68
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,602
Uh-huh. l see what's going on here.

69
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,687
You think l can help influence
the Chancellor.

70
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:41,024
The Zillo Beast was chained up
and brought here against its will.

71
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,735
lt has no voice to defend itself.

72
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,405
Anakin, we have to be that voice.

73
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:51,576
You haven't seen it in action.
You have no idea what it's capable of.

74
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,496
lt's what we're capable of
that frightens me.

75
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,542
A creature's life,
maybe even an entire species, is at stake.

76
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,378
Doesn't that at least warrant a discussion?

77
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,007
l didn't think you'd feel
so strongly about it.

78
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,718
All right, let's speak to the Chancellor.

79
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,179
But l still don't like this.

80
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,726
l should have known secrets
do not stay secret for long around here.

81
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,938
lsn't that precisely the point
of a democracy?

82
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:23,191
Of course, in wartime,
some things must be kept secret.

83
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,777
Even from the people,
so as not to aid the enemy.

84
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,322
lt is unfortunate
that the Beast must die, Senator.

85
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,241
But the greater good demands it.

86
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:35,370
How is killing the last of a species,
in secret and without debate,

87
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,038
good for anyone?

88
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:41,877
Don't you have more pressing issues
that require your attention today?

89
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,796
No, Mr. Speaker, l do not.

90
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:49,718
l sympathize, my dear, truly l do.
But consider this.

91
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,722
A democracy is only as strong
as the people who comprise it.

92
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,558
At present,
the people l am charged with protecting

93
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,144
are dying faster than l can count.

94
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,565
lt is my moral imperative to take action.

95
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:08,236
Anakin, is it not worth
the life of one savage beast

96
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:12,324
to give our brave troops
the advantage they need to win this war?

97
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:19,122
My role is not to set policy, Chancellor,
but l do see both points of view.

98
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:22,083
l'm certain a reasonable solution
will present itself.

99
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,920
Master Kenobi has taught you well.

100
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,630
Chancellor.

101
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,424
Excuse me.

102
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:35,972
You are supposed to be helping!
Whose side are you on, anyway?

103
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:40,435
Yours, but you must admit the Chancellor
makes some good points.

104
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:52,948
<i>Ah, Doctor Boll,
l trust you have some progress to report.</i>

105
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:59,663
Yes, Chancellor. l was able to convert
the Malastare fuel toxin into a poison gas.

106
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:03,416
l believe it's now strong enough
to kill the Zillo Beast,

107
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,628
if that's still how you wish to proceed.

108
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,130
<i>l wish l saw an alternative.</i>

109
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:13,343
<i>However, sadly l must ask you
to proceed with your assignment.</i>

110
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,071
l'm sorry.
Don't worry, it will all be over soon.

111
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,490
Begin procedure.

112
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,246
Vital signs are dropping.

113
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,345
No. lt should have been enough.

114
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,703
l don't like the sound of that.

115
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,624
lf that creature is as powerful as they say,
what good are these rifles gonna be?

116
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,292
Ah, shut up, Kosmos.

117
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,187
l'm on it, Leader.

118
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,230
Take it down! Take it down!
Man down!

119
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,899
You in the black, let's go!

120
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,317
Head up!

121
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,153
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Hold. Everyone, back!

122
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,200
Oh, no.

123
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,789
Doctor, were you successful?

124
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,332
<i>We have a problem, sir.</i>

125
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:22,722
<i>We need time to convert Malastare fuel
into more toxin, Chancellor.</i>

126
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,516
l suggest you hurry, Doctor.

127
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,727
Evacuate the staff
to the underground shelters.

128
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,355
Stay with General Kenobi. l'm on my way.

129
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,816
<i>Better hurry, sir.
You're missing all the fun.</i>

130
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,658
<i>l have no doubt the Jedi...</i>

131
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,537
<i>...to ensure the safety...</i>

132
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,175
<i>...that l will not stand...</i>

133
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,552
lt's coming this way!

134
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,374
Perhaps now would be a good time
to evacuate to the lower levels.

135
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,050
Yes. We are going now.

136
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,565
<i>Desperately needed the tanks are.</i>

137
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,943
We're almost at the loading dock,
Master Yoda.

138
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,487
Dire the situation has become.

139
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,782
Before more lives are lost,
act quickly we must.

140
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:57,669
My security staff insisted on adding
this emergency escape route.

141
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:08,096
<i>Chancellor, l think we may have
enough toxin now.</i>

142
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,014
My guards will be with you shortly.

143
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,520
Hand the gas over to them immediately.

144
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,522
Does it have to be destroyed?

145
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,859
- The Jedi stun cannons...
- Will not eliminate the problem.

146
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,945
Our advanced technology
simply cannot contain it.

147
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,322
l wish we had
never brought the Beast here.

148
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:34,455
Pardon me, Mistress Padmé,
but l believe something is following us.

149
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,916
Evasive action!

150
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,804
We're doomed!

151
00:14:56,312 --> 00:15:00,273
All tanks acquire solution
and prepare to fire on my order.

152
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,777
Hold your fire.
ln the Beast's clutches the Chancellor is.

153
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,363
Anakin might be with him,
and Senator Amidala.

154
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,867
lf the Beast falls,
at risk their lives shall be.

155
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,299
l've got an idea, but it's risky.

156
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,968
Considering the circumstances,
l'll take the risk.

157
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,850
l've got a bad feeling about this.

158
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,480
Sir, looks like
the General's up to something.

159
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,859
What is Skywalker doing?

160
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:50,198
lt appears to be
one ofAnakin's improvised plans.

161
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,034
How can it be a plan if it's improvised?

162
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,954
Not to worry.
Just catch them when they fall.

163
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,790
A lot of the General's plans involve falling.

164
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:02,627
Distract the Beast we shall,
to give Skywalker more time.

165
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,072
l hope you know what you're doing.

166
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,742
Here's where the fun begins. Hang on!

167
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,009
Catch it!

168
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,617
Ani!

169
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,154
All pilots, fire.

170
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,649
Sir, we have to get you out of here.

171
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,783
Artoo, get over there!

172
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,666
lt can't carry both of us. You go, sir.

173
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,012
Oh, no!

174
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:04,142
- We aren't having much of an effect!
- Time to leave, it is.

175
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,355
Oh, no!

176
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,318
Let's go!

177
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,910
Use the gas bombs!

178
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,579
Copy that.

179
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:31,752
Bombs away!

180
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:25,449
lt's a tragedy that the Zillo Beast
paid with its life for our mistakes.

181
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:29,203
l will make certain that sacrifice
was not made in vain.

182
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,672
Doctor, a word if you please.

183
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,466
Your new orders.

184
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,343
What is this?

185
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:47,471
You want me to clone the Beast?
