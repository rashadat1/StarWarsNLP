1
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:21,228
<i>Diplomacy or deception?</i>

2
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,898
<i>The Council of Neutral Systems
speaks for over 1,500 worlds</i>

3
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,984
<i>who want to stay out of the war.</i>

4
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,319
<i>But rumors have reached
the Republic Senate</i>

5
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:33,240
<i>suggesting that the Council's new leader,
Duchess Satine of Mandalore,</i>

6
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:37,870
<i>is secretly building her own army
to fight for the Separatist cause.</i>

7
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:41,707
<i>Now Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi
has been sent to Mandalore</i>

8
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,752
<i>to discover the truth behind these claims.</i>

9
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,933
The Duchess awaits you, General Kenobi.

10
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,313
Far be it for me
to keep the Duchess waiting.

11
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,336
General Kenobi.

12
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,380
Thank you for meeting with me,
Prime Minister Almec.

13
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,591
l welcome you as a servant of the people.

14
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:36,261
But l am troubled by the false rumors
that brought you here.

15
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,014
Mandalore would never turn
against the Republic.

16
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:42,726
The Duchess Satine values peace
more than her own life.

17
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,686
Oh, l'm aware of the Duchess's views.

18
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,440
Master Kenobi,
Mandalore's violent past is behind us.

19
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:52,319
All of our warriors were exiled
to our moon, Concordia.

20
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,404
They died out years ago.

21
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,116
Hmm. Are you certain?

22
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,870
l recently encountered a man
who wore Mandalorian armor. Jango Fett.

23
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:06,792
Jango Fett was a common bounty hunter.
How he acquired that armor is beyond me.

24
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,294
Well, Master Kenobi.

25
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,673
My shining Jedi Knight
to the rescue once again.

26
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,808
After all these years,
you're even more beautiful than ever.

27
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,894
Kind words from a man
who accuses me of treachery.

28
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:31,233
l would never accuse you
of personal wrongdoing, Duchess.

29
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:35,195
However, a Separatist saboteur
attacked one of our Republic cruisers.

30
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,239
A Mandalorian saboteur.

31
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,915
You must be mistaken.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,711
No Mandalorian would engage
in such violence, not anymore.

33
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,588
Where is this prisoner now?

34
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,716
He took his own life
rather than submit to questioning.

35
00:02:56,426 --> 00:03:00,012
l know these commandos fought
in many wars, often against the Jedi.

36
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:03,432
Every one of my people
is as trustworthy as l am.

37
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:07,519
- l know we sound defensive, but...
- Clearly, your investigation was ordered

38
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,939
because the Senate is eager
to intervene in our affairs.

39
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,610
My investigation was ordered
by the Jedi Council.

40
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,196
l stand corrected.

41
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,909
General Kenobi, perhaps you'd like
to join me on a walk through the city.

42
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,141
lt's so good to see you again, Obi-Wan,

43
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,560
despite the circumstances.

44
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,896
Your peaceful ways have paid off.

45
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,732
Mandalore has prospered
since the last time l was here.

46
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:56,652
Not everyone on Mandalore believes
that our commitment to peace

47
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,987
is a sign of progress.

48
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,741
There is a group
that calls itself Death Watch.

49
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,994
l imagine these are the renegades
you're looking for.

50
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,123
They idolize violence
and the warrior ways of the past.

51
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,084
There are those among us,
certain officials,

52
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:15,045
who are working
to root out these criminals.

53
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,339
lt has been an ongoing investigation.

54
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,384
How widespread is
this Death Watch movement?

55
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:24,179
lt's hardly a movement.
lt's a small group of hooligans

56
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,641
who choose to vandalize public places,
nothing more.

57
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,185
We shall soon have them in custody.

58
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,272
We have tracked them down
to our moon, Concordia.

59
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,982
l hope you're right, Duchess.

60
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:44,533
l do not understand why
the arrival of this Jedi doesn't upset you.

61
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,535
You promised to support
the Death Watch forces

62
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,455
so we could overthrow the Duchess Satine
and her weak, peace-loving government.

63
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,667
<i>And l intend to keep my promise.</i>

64
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,586
But how? lf the Republic interferes now,

65
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,423
Death Watch will not be able
to take over the planet.

66
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:04,219
<i>Consider, once the Senate orders
peacekeeping troops to Mandalore,</i>

67
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,932
<i>the people will be surrounded by
a military presence. Most distasteful.</i>

68
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,812
- <i>They will rebel.</i>
- And rally to Death Watch.

69
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,398
Our insurgency will grow stronger.

70
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:20,110
<i>Yes. And Duchess Satine shall fall.</i>

71
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,119
A peacekeeper belongs
on the front lines of conflict.

72
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:28,705
Otherwise, he wouldn't
be able to do his job.

73
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:34,002
The work of a peacekeeper is
to make sure that conflict does not arise.

74
00:05:34,086 --> 00:05:37,547
Yes, a noble description,
but not a realistic one.

75
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:41,301
ls reality what makes a Jedi
abandon his ideals?

76
00:05:41,385 --> 00:05:44,804
Or is it simply a response
to political convenience?

77
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,393
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine.

78
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:00,528
Hooligans couldn't have arranged
an attack of this scale.

79
00:06:01,322 --> 00:06:03,865
Then this must be the work
of an offworlder.

80
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:06,701
Are you sure of that?

81
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,792
The sign of the Death Watch.

82
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,421
This goes far beyond vandalism.

83
00:06:18,631 --> 00:06:21,633
This is a political statement
against your government.

84
00:06:21,675 --> 00:06:23,468
And against you.

85
00:06:23,552 --> 00:06:27,222
You're not safe here.
l'm taking you back to the palace.

86
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:33,395
l want to interview everyone here.
Nobody leaves this scene.

87
00:06:36,065 --> 00:06:37,482
You there!

88
00:06:53,165 --> 00:06:54,999
l only want to talk.

89
00:07:04,885 --> 00:07:06,719
l don't want to hurt you.

90
00:07:07,388 --> 00:07:08,721
Stay back!

91
00:07:42,673 --> 00:07:44,299
What is he saying?

92
00:07:57,605 --> 00:08:02,442
He was speaking in the dialect
they use on Concordia, our moon.

93
00:08:02,568 --> 00:08:07,238
l should like to visit this moon of yours.
Perhaps l could accompany the body.

94
00:08:07,323 --> 00:08:10,700
The Concordian moon is a province
with its own governor.

95
00:08:10,743 --> 00:08:12,452
You'll need me to escort you.

96
00:08:12,578 --> 00:08:15,872
- That won't be necessary.
- Actually, it will.

97
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:18,374
You won't make much progress
without me there,

98
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:21,920
especially since you've just been involved
with the death of a Concordian.

99
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:24,506
- l didn't kill him.
- l know.

100
00:08:24,924 --> 00:08:26,716
That's why l'm still talking to you.

101
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:52,116
l thought Concordia was
an agricultural settlement.

102
00:08:52,243 --> 00:08:55,870
Before the end of our wars,
they turned it into a mining base.

103
00:08:55,955 --> 00:09:00,083
The sheer number of mining facilities here
nearly destroyed our forests.

104
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,918
They're finally growing back.

105
00:09:19,895 --> 00:09:23,940
- Duchess Satine. You are most welcome.
- Thank you, Governor Vizsla.

106
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:28,653
May l present Master Obi-Wan Kenobi,
representing the Jedi Council.

107
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:31,447
Governor Vizsla
is one of the officials l spoke of.

108
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,075
He has been working to find
the members of the Death Watch.

109
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,828
l take it you've heard the rumors
about Satine.

110
00:09:36,954 --> 00:09:39,163
About how she's supposedly
leading Mandalore

111
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,291
into an alliance with the Separatists.

112
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,793
My only instructions are to seek the truth.

113
00:09:43,836 --> 00:09:47,005
This was the man
who bombed the Memorial Shrine?

114
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:50,091
Yes. He was apparently
part of Death Watch.

115
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:52,635
A worrisome prospect.

116
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:55,179
lf you'll pardon me, General,
we must attend to the body.

117
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:00,571
l need a favor from you.

118
00:10:00,655 --> 00:10:03,240
Please keep Governor Vizsla
occupied at dinner.

119
00:10:03,324 --> 00:10:06,201
- Where are you going?
- Just for a look around.

120
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:09,079
l'd like to see one of these
mining facilities for myself.

121
00:10:09,164 --> 00:10:12,666
You mean you want to determine
if they're still operational.

122
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:15,169
l hope to determine they're not.

123
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:18,964
l want you to wear this earpiece
so that we can stay in contact,

124
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:21,633
in case you run into trouble
while l'm gone.

125
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:26,722
Remember that you are here
under my protection.

126
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:30,392
Please try not to cause problems
where none yet exist.

127
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:33,979
Think of me as searching for solutions.

128
00:10:34,064 --> 00:10:37,399
l have to tell you,
l'm opposed to all of this.

129
00:10:37,484 --> 00:10:39,318
l'd be disappointed if you weren't.

130
00:10:54,084 --> 00:10:55,584
Forgive me, Duchess.

131
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:58,629
l'm writing a condolence letter
to the dead man's family

132
00:10:58,713 --> 00:11:01,465
and making arrangements
for them to retrieve his body.

133
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:03,342
Of course, Governor. Very proper.

134
00:11:04,052 --> 00:11:08,806
General Kenobi will join us shortly.
He said he needed to meditate.

135
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:40,629
lt doesn't look abandoned to me.

136
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:09,116
l am here on a diplomatic mission
under the protection of Duchess Satine.

137
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,493
We do not recognize her rule.

138
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:28,635
Someone is feeding misinformation
directly to the Republic Senate,

139
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,055
saying that the Death Watch
is taking over Mandalore.

140
00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:34,725
Who stands to gain from these lies?

141
00:12:35,602 --> 00:12:37,186
Death Watch, of course.

142
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,188
They could not engineer all this.

143
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:42,983
The problem has clearly grown
much larger than we thought,

144
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:46,695
and l suspect
some external force helped it along.

145
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:48,906
Hard to believe.
lt would have to be someone

146
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,825
at the highest level of influence
among the Separatists.

147
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,119
But why target me?

148
00:12:54,204 --> 00:12:58,457
You lead the Council of Neutral Systems.
Thus you threaten the Separatists' goals.

149
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,083
Take it as a compliment.

150
00:13:00,168 --> 00:13:03,795
Someone very powerful
is working towards your downfall.

151
00:13:17,977 --> 00:13:19,937
The commander wants us
to sweep the area

152
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:23,315
and check for any other Jedi
until he arrives.

153
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,277
This one's harmless enough
without his lightsaber.

154
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:29,404
The boss will love this.

155
00:13:36,871 --> 00:13:40,624
General Kenobi's meditation
is taking a rather long time.

156
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,586
You know the Jedi,
they never do anything by halves.

157
00:13:44,671 --> 00:13:46,880
<i>Duchess, please acknowledge.</i>

158
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:50,842
- May l offer you another drink?
- Yes. Certainly.

159
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:54,346
<i>l'm in a bit of an awkward spot.
l'm being held by the Death Watch.</i>

160
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:57,182
Sorry, Duchess. We're out of ice.

161
00:13:57,934 --> 00:13:59,643
Sorry to hear that.

162
00:14:01,646 --> 00:14:04,898
Perhaps we should begin dinner
without General Kenobi.

163
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:08,694
<i>There's a tracking function on your comlink.
Follow it due east to my location.</i>

164
00:14:08,778 --> 00:14:11,363
l don't know if l can do that
at the moment.

165
00:14:11,447 --> 00:14:15,242
- <i>lt's extremely urgent!</i>
- Are you not feeling well, Duchess?

166
00:14:15,326 --> 00:14:18,412
Perhaps some fresh air would do me good.

167
00:14:18,496 --> 00:14:20,914
Shall l escort you outside?

168
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:23,000
<i>Take a speeder,
it's rough terrain.</i>

169
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:25,460
Oh, l'll find my way, never fear.

170
00:14:46,858 --> 00:14:47,899
Yes, sir.

171
00:14:47,942 --> 00:14:52,070
Start the machine. Time for the Jedi
to meet with his fatal accident.

172
00:14:52,447 --> 00:14:53,947
With pleasure.

173
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,542
This is not good.

174
00:15:15,386 --> 00:15:17,012
Where exactly are you?

175
00:15:17,388 --> 00:15:20,807
Listen for the loud, metallic,
clanging sound.

176
00:15:20,892 --> 00:15:23,435
That would be the machine
about to smash me into bits.

177
00:15:37,283 --> 00:15:40,452
There's some kind of disturbance
at the entrance. Let's check it out.

178
00:15:47,794 --> 00:15:49,628
Well, it certainly took you long enough.

179
00:15:49,712 --> 00:15:51,880
You know, l haven't saved you yet!

180
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:55,467
- Yes, no need to remind me of that.
- Be patient.

181
00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:57,677
l happen to be a bit short on patience
right now!

182
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:02,516
Now, let's see, one of these...

183
00:16:04,394 --> 00:16:08,230
- Satine, turn the machine off!
- l'm trying!

184
00:16:08,314 --> 00:16:09,564
Satine!

185
00:16:10,942 --> 00:16:11,983
There!

186
00:16:20,368 --> 00:16:21,451
Look out!

187
00:16:38,678 --> 00:16:40,262
For a man sworn to peace,

188
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:43,849
you take an unseemly pleasure
in the injuries of others.

189
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:46,476
For a woman sworn to non-violence,

190
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:49,354
you don't seem troubled
that l could have been killed back there.

191
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:53,650
But you weren't.
And yet l still haven't heard any thanks.

192
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:56,361
Well, you certainly haven't changed much.

193
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:02,868
This is not the way we came in.

194
00:17:03,661 --> 00:17:05,787
Look there, it's the Jedi.

195
00:17:19,177 --> 00:17:22,971
We'll have to stand and fight.
Or in your case, just stand.

196
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,935
You three, stop him.

197
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:54,753
You there!

198
00:18:01,928 --> 00:18:03,887
- Satine!
- l'm all right.

199
00:18:04,597 --> 00:18:07,516
l'll deal with this.
Get to your ships and evacuate.

200
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:26,785
Failure.

201
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:41,466
Governor?

202
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:46,304
For generations, my ancestors fought
proudly as warriors against the Jedi.

203
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,433
Now that woman tarnishes
the very name Mandalorian.

204
00:18:51,602 --> 00:18:53,270
Defend her, if you will.

205
00:18:57,149 --> 00:19:00,610
This lightsaber was stolen
from your Jedi Temple

206
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:04,489
by my ancestors
during the fall of the Old Republic.

207
00:19:04,615 --> 00:19:08,368
Since then, many Jedi have died
upon its blade.

208
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:10,662
Prepare yourself to join them.

209
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:01,713
Warriors, finish him!

210
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:14,267
Satine?

211
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:29,574
- Should we go after him, sir?
- No, there's no time.

212
00:20:29,617 --> 00:20:33,286
Don't worry, we'll catch up
with the Duchess soon enough.

213
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,999
l suppose we're even now.

214
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:42,545
- Oh? How so?
- l saved your life, you saved mine.

215
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:46,633
Yes, well, mine was the more daring
of the two rescues.

216
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:57,060
But if Pre Vizsla fled,

217
00:20:57,103 --> 00:21:01,773
we have no way of learning
how widespread Death Watch really is.

218
00:21:01,816 --> 00:21:04,901
lt's obvious the Separatists
are supporting the Death Watch.

219
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:10,657
l disagree. l told you
l wanted to stay out of this conflict.

220
00:21:11,117 --> 00:21:17,122
Given the current situation,
l'm afraid that may no longer be possible.

221
00:21:17,957 --> 00:21:23,795
l thought you of all people would
understand my position on this matter.

222
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:26,798
l will never be a part of this war.

223
00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:36,141
Reporting for escort duty, General.

224
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,477
Oh. Anakin, am l glad to see you.

225
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:42,105
You sound tired.

226
00:21:42,148 --> 00:21:45,817
The peaceful ways of the locals
wore me out a bit.
