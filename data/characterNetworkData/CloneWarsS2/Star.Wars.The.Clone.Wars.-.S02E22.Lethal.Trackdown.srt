1
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,811
<i>Lethal trackdown!</i>

2
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:24,314
<i>The young Boba Fett
has taken the law into his own hands</i>

3
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,192
<i>and made two attempts
on the life of Mace Windu,</i>

4
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,195
<i>the Jedi Master who killed his father.</i>

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,659
<i>Boba's mentor, bounty hunter Aurra Sing,
has taken three Republic officers hostage</i>

6
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:39,747
<i>in an effort to force Windu to face Boba
on their terms.</i>

7
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:43,542
<i>A tactic that does not sit well
with the young vigilante.</i>

8
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,058
This isn't what l wanted.

9
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,400
You don't have to do this.
You're not like them. l can tell.

10
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:12,988
- What do you know, old man?
- l know a good soldier when l see one.

11
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,992
l'm no soldier!
l'm no clone, not like those two!

12
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,830
- What? What are you looking at?
- Boba! What's going on?

13
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,832
Nothing!

14
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,380
What are we going to do with them?

15
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:34,551
Oh, l think our friends here
are about to finally prove useful.

16
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:56,657
So? What are you planning to do
with this son of Jango Fett?

17
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,201
l am not planning to do anything.

18
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,371
That kid destroyed an entire cruiser
trying to get to you,

19
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,123
and you're just going to let it go?

20
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,626
ls there something else
l should be doing, Skywalker?

21
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,711
How about tracking him down?

22
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:14,133
So l should behave as this child does?
l should seek revenge?

23
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:19,763
No. How is it revenge if you stop this kid
and bring him to justice?

24
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:23,559
ln case you hadn't noticed,
we are fighting a war.

25
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,020
We have a situation.

26
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,857
We received a transmission
from the bounty hunters.

27
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,488
They apparently took hostages.

28
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,492
<i>Mace Windu, you were lucky to escape.</i>

29
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,204
<i>Your friends here were not so fortunate.</i>

30
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,000
<i>Until you face Boba,
these men will be killed, one at a time.</i>

31
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,586
<i>What's your name?</i>

32
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,671
<i>Name!</i>

33
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,757
<i>CT 4-11.</i>

34
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,968
<i>Pathetic. Boba, do it.</i>

35
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,305
<i>Boba!</i>

36
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,476
That was Ponds.

37
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:12,191
<i>Only two to go, Windu.
Come and find us. We'll be waiting.</i>

38
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,321
- l'll go.
- l thought you had bigger concerns.

39
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,949
That was before we knew
hostages were involved.

40
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,619
You are too injured to travel,

41
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,788
and your presence
would only aggravate the boy.

42
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,958
l shall go,
and take Padawan Tano with me.

43
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,976
Next time l tell you to pull the trigger,
you do it!

44
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:59,947
lt should only be a matter of time
until they track us down.

45
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,160
Something on your mind, Castas?

46
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:09,748
Yeah, l got something to say.
We're in over our heads.

47
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,085
You signed on to kill Jedi.
Well, this is how it's done.

48
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,838
You said the Separatists would pay well
if we killed Windu.

49
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:21,677
That kid destroyed an entire cruiser,
and now we're taking hostages.

50
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,054
That was not part of the plan.

51
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,807
l never took you for a coward, Castas.

52
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,893
And what about you, Bossk?
You feel the same?

53
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:33,480
l'm still in. l got a lot riding on this kill,

54
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,400
and l need the cash.

55
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,819
Not me. l'm out.

56
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:42,656
Well then, you're in luck.
l was planning on making a stop.

57
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,951
You can drag your worthless carcass
off of this ship when we land.

58
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:49,371
- Where are we headed?
- We're going to visit an old friend.

59
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,707
Maybe he can replace Castas.

60
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,792
Set course for Florrum.

61
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,559
Master Plo, l don't understand.

62
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:14,563
Shouldn't we be heading for the last place
we knew Boba Fett was spotted?

63
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,607
Why head to the one place
we know he is not?

64
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,747
Whoa!

65
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:38,754
The second bounty hunter
in the hologram is Aurra Sing.

66
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,422
Another bounty hunter.

67
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,718
- Like his father, Jango Fett.
- Mmm. Yes.

68
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:51,099
lt seems this boy found himself in the care
of at least one of Jango's associates.

69
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:55,896
So we're looking for friends of Jango Fett,
or places where they hang out?

70
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:59,983
And to do that, we must go
to the lower levels.

71
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,444
The underworld.

72
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,296
<i>Move along. Move along.</i>

73
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,471
<i>Move along. Move along.</i>

74
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,642
<i>Yourpass, please.
Your pass, please.</i>

75
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,478
<i>Your pass, please.</i>

76
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,152
<i>Your pass, please. Your pass, please.</i>

77
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:48,323
The data on Jango Fett suggested
he frequented this area.

78
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,826
We must be cautious.

79
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:29,573
- Come on, punch him! Yeah! Get him!
- Punch his teeth out! Yeah!

80
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:41,168
Oh, my dear, you never were good
at asking for permission to land.

81
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,588
l never ask for permission
to do anything, my darling.

82
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,800
Yes!

83
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,720
Yes, l remember.

84
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,517
Not mine, l take it?

85
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,730
No, part of my crew. He's Jango's son.

86
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,192
Oh. Yes, yes.

87
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:11,031
Sorry about your father.
He was a friend, and an honorable man.

88
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:18,121
And that's Castas.
But he's getting off here.

89
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:23,793
Couldn't handle her, could you?
Well, don't be ashamed,

90
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,465
you're not the first man to bail out
from under her command.

91
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,675
He's speaking from experience.

92
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,803
Oh!

93
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,097
Oh, you're a dangerous woman.

94
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,475
Yes, very dangerous.

95
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,144
Come, come, come! Let us go inside,

96
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,398
where we can discuss business
over a drink like civilized people.

97
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,506
l'm stuck out here on Florrum.

98
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:14,344
<i>l warned you.
Working with Aurra Sing is bad business.</i>

99
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:20,183
Yeah. This job's gone south,
like every job l do with that hag.

100
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,442
No, Boba.

101
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:37,284
l hear there's a downed
Republic cruiser on Vanqor.

102
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:41,121
- Your handiwork?
- l wouldn't take credit for that, no.

103
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,084
We saw it, though.
Crawling with Republic troops.

104
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,212
l wouldn't try and salvage it for a while
if l were you.

105
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,132
l appreciate the advice.

106
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,928
So, Boba, what is it like
working with Aurra?

107
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,680
lt's all right.
lt must be...

108
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,558
<i>l have some information.</i>

109
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:05,270
<i>lnformation that's worth something
to the right people.</i>

110
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:10,108
- <i>Really? What kind of people?</i>
- That's where you come in.

111
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,111
Remember, Aurra?
That job we pulled?

112
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,280
Hmm? Oh, yes.

113
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,656
Excuse me.

114
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,201
- Castas!
- Huh?

115
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:31,296
Hey! Hey!
Someone scrape that guy off the floor.

116
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,340
He sprung a leak.

117
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,607
Well, l hope we have better luck here.

118
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:54,694
This is the fifth scum-bucket drinking hole
we've been to.

119
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,532
Yes. And this time, try to be more subtle.

120
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,285
What do you mean?

121
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,705
You've adopted
many of your master's ways,

122
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,709
including a lack of subtlety.

123
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,879
Sorry, Master Plo.

124
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:18,176
Just try to blend in. Listen.

125
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:23,390
You may be surprised what people reveal
when they have been drinking.

126
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,696
Have a look around.

127
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:50,542
- l need some information.
- We're not selling that here, pal.

128
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,172
lt's been a while
since we had one of you down here.

129
00:11:56,257 --> 00:12:00,343
Aren't you a bit busy with your war
to be bothering with the likes of us?

130
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:04,472
We are never too busy
for the citizens of the Republic.

131
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,646
l'm not getting anywhere.

132
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,233
Okay, try to relax.

133
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,823
Like Master Plo says, l'm listening.

134
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,325
Listening...

135
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:29,748
This war is killing me.
My whole business has gone under.

136
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,876
Oh. Give me another round.

137
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:39,174
l saw her last night, on the video screen.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

138
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:44,220
- l'm gonna ask her out.
- She'll never go out with you.

139
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:47,390
She's gonna go out with me!

140
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:51,686
Florrum? A buddy of mine
was just murdered on Florrum.

141
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,354
Murder?

142
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:58,818
Yeah, yeah, he was working a big job.
At least, that is what he said.

143
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,199
He was telling me he had some
valuable information on a holotransmitter,

144
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:09,537
and then, boom, she shot him.
lt must have been some good dirt.

145
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:14,667
What's her name?
Hope it's not who l think it is.

146
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:19,255
He was working with Aurra Sing.
She is bad news.

147
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,760
That's her, all right.
She's the boss's ex.

148
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,304
There's always trouble
when she shows up.

149
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,807
Yeah, that's the one.

150
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,019
Find something interesting, kid?

151
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,022
What's this? What are you reaching for?

152
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:44,697
- Stand down!
- You can't take us all, Jedi.

153
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:49,327
Would you like to try
and prove your theory?

154
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,456
Hey, nobody's shooting up my place today!

155
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,708
He's right.

156
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,963
- Drinks on the house.
- Now wait a minute!

157
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,844
Not very subtle.

158
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,640
- l was being subtle.
- lnteresting result.

159
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:15,353
But, Master, you were right.
l heard about a murder.

160
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:18,439
A murder Aurra Sing recently committed.

161
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,733
- Where?
- Florrum.

162
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,528
Well done, little Ahsoka.

163
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,239
We're off to Florrum.

164
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:37,667
Well, my dear, you are in
an interesting predicament once again.

165
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,964
Getting involved with the Jedi
is never a good idea.

166
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:48,803
<i>Aurra, we've got an incoming ship.
Jedi, by the look of it.</i>

167
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,015
- Windu!
- Finally. Took them long enough.

168
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:56,144
Move <i>Slave l</i> to the outskirts
and get the hostages ready.

169
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,812
<i>Right.</i>

170
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,690
So, are you in or not?

171
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:06,029
l will not help you.
But l will not hinder you, either.

172
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:10,033
This is your fight, not mine.

173
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,905
Hello, hello,
and welcome to Florrum.

174
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:53,493
l should assume
you are walking us into a trap.

175
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,663
Yes, you should.
They're waiting inside the bar.

176
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,541
l have no idea
what she has planned for you.

177
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,628
And the reason you're telling us is?

178
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,674
So you know
that l am not involved in this.

179
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,011
Remember, patience.

180
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,903
Bad move, Jedi. This will cost you.

181
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,908
l wanted Windu. What are you doing here?

182
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,495
We can do this the difficult way,
or the simple way.

183
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,414
The choice is yours.

184
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:44,168
- Bossk, can you hear me?
- <i>Roger.</i>

185
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,671
Execute the hostages if l give the word.

186
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,676
Unwise. You have already lost,
and you don't even know it.

187
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:56,848
l am prepared to kill you, the hostages,
whatever it takes

188
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:01,686
- to get what Boba wants.
- Sounds more like what you want.

189
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,232
Don't.

190
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,071
Aurra? Aurra!

191
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:18,202
Bad news, boys.
lf l don't hear from her soon, l'm gone,

192
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,538
and you're both fried.

193
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,210
- Let her go!
- No chance.

194
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,213
She won't do it, Boba. She's not like you.

195
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:33,676
- She's right. l'm not a murderer.
- l'm not a murderer!

196
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:37,764
- But l want justice.
- We are justice.

197
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,892
Don't listen to them.

198
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,437
No one will be harmed if you come quietly.

199
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,276
- l can't let you die.
- You won't have to.

200
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,327
Aurra!

201
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,962
lt's over. Surrender!

202
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,048
Aurra! Now!

203
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,258
Bomb!

204
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,680
Boba, hurry!

205
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,935
Aurra, help! Help me!

206
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,110
Don't leave me! No!

207
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,655
The hostages, where are they?

208
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:40,451
Boba, if you do not tell us where
those men are, they are going to die!

209
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,412
- lnnocent men!
- She left me.

210
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,898
He will not reveal
the location of the hostages.

211
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,776
l thought you might talk
some sense into him.

212
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:18,239
Tell the Jedi
what he wants to know, Boba.

213
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,410
Why should l help anybody?
l've got no one!

214
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,247
lt is the honorable thing to do.

215
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,959
lt's what your father would have wanted.

216
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:56,777
<i>Ahsoka, she's trying to lead you
away from the hostages.</i>

217
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,405
<i>Go to coordinates 1-5-7-9.</i>

218
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,792
Time's up.

219
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:19,967
Don't move.

220
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,928
No! No!

221
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,079
l see now l've done terrible things.

222
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,707
But you started
when you murdered my father.

223
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,043
- l'll never forgive you.
- Mmm.

224
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,506
Well, you're going to have to.

225
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,174
Take him away.
