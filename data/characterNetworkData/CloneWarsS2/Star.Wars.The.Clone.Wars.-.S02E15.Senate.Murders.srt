1
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,436
<i>War on many fronts!</i>

2
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:23,230
<i>While battles are fought
by clones in the field,</i>

3
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:26,191
<i>a different war is waged
in the Galactic Senate.</i>

4
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:30,654
<i>As heavy losses add up, a group
of senators led by Halle Burtoni of Kamino</i>

5
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,532
<i>propose an escalation of troop production.</i>

6
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,117
<i>Senator Padmé Amidala,</i>

7
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,370
<i>recognizing that more troops
will only prolong the fighting,</i>

8
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:42,875
<i>works tirelessly with her allies to
introduce a bill to cut military spending</i>

9
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,045
<i>and stop the creation
of more clone troopers.</i>

10
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,260
Yes, of course, Senator.
Thank you for telling me yourself.

11
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,387
l completely understand.

12
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,307
Did we lose someone else's vote?

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,727
Senator Stonk.
Worried about public opinion.

14
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:05,022
But he wants us to know
how very sorry he is.

15
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:08,567
- "Sorry" doesn't get us votes.
- We'll get votes

16
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:14,364
when, in your speech, you convince people
to stand up for what they know is right.

17
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,408
l hope you're right, Uncle.

18
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,661
You've been doing an amazing job
rallying votes to our side.

19
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,622
<i>Chos koo</i>, Senator Farr.

20
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:31,757
Perhaps l am the most influential man
on Rodia, Lolo,

21
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:38,680
but after all the mistakes l've made,
peace is what matters to me now.

22
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:43,477
Senator Amidala? They're ready
for your speech now. lt's time.

23
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,815
We'll see you in the Chamber,
Senator Amidala.

24
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,942
Good luck, Padmé!

25
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,489
lt is quite exciting.

26
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,367
"Exciting" isn't exactly
the word l would use.

27
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,869
l think "terrifying" is more appropriate.

28
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,123
Pay her no mind, Senator Organa.

29
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,876
Even as a girl,
Padmé downplayed her strengths.

30
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:11,213
Helps her maintain
the element of surprise.

31
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:15,342
l learned it from you.
See you inside, Senators.

32
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,559
<i>The creation of more warriors
will not end this war.</i>

33
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:27,729
<i>The financial costs alone will bankrupt
and cripple the Republic.</i>

34
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:32,234
<i>By adding more clones to the conflict,
we are only escalating destruction,</i>

35
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,153
<i>not winning the war.</i>

36
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,239
<i>Which is why we must vote
for this resolution,</i>

37
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,324
<i>to promote more diplomacy</i>

38
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,911
<i>and to bring an end
to this killing and hatred.</i>

39
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:13,233
- That was quite a moment, my dear.
- Thank you, Senator Deechi.

40
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,361
Oh, it wasn't a compliment.

41
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:22,868
You shouldn't make speeches like that.
lt's unpatriotic.

42
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:26,872
The only thing l find unpatriotic
is your warmongering.

43
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,096
Truly, you have turned the tide!

44
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,644
- My dear, you were brilliant.
- Thank you.

45
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,480
But perhaps we should wait
till we actually win the vote

46
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:55,484
- before we make a victory speech.
- What a novel idea.

47
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:03,825
lmagine that. Amidala's actually
making sense for once in her life.

48
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:08,080
Senator Burtoni,
this is a private conversation.

49
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:12,459
Private conversation
or Separatist conspiracy?

50
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:17,256
How dare you? We are not pro-Separatist.
We want to end the war.

51
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,510
Committing more troops to the front lines
will not allow diplomacy to resume.

52
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,972
Diplomacy failed the Republic long ago.

53
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,517
- Senators, please!
- Senator Burtoni.

54
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:32,020
The Kaminoans might have bartered
their creation of the clones

55
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,564
into a seat in the Galactic Senate,

56
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,484
but this does not give you free rein.

57
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,529
Thank you for visiting, Senator.

58
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:45,409
We would like to continue
our meeting now, if you don't mind.

59
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,870
Enjoy your moment
in the spotlight, Senators.

60
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,540
This war will not end soon.

61
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:02,050
Well, we must be doing something right
if we've rattled Senator Burtoni.

62
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:06,388
What matters is that we've made
great strides in our fight against this bill.

63
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,349
Ono, you've done a wonderful job
leading the effort.

64
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,394
l am just trying to do what's right.

65
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:16,189
l only wish l'd tried doing that
a long time ago.

66
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,400
You're doing it now.

67
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,903
To victory and an end to this war!

68
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,406
To victories.

69
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,451
My heart.

70
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,580
- l can't breathe.
- Uncle, what is it?

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,669
Ono! lt's his heart!
Please, someone get help!

72
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,304
And we are all aware
that Onaconda was a flawed man.

73
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,099
He knew better than anyone
of his own mistakes.

74
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,019
But he never compromised his principles.

75
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,650
And what he did, he did for his people.
Their needs always came first.

76
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:17,793
- Senator, if you need anything...
- What we need

77
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,878
is to get his resolution passed.

78
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,654
He was my mentor. l don't know
how to carry on without him guiding me.

79
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,907
l know. No one could ever take his place.

80
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:53,620
Excuse me, Chancellor Palpatine has
summoned both of you to his chambers.

81
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,382
- What's happened?
- l'm afraid, my friends,

82
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,552
that Lieutenant Divo here
has some questions.

83
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,470
About Senator Farr.

84
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,974
Do you know of anyone who,

85
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,477
hmm, how to put this,

86
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,857
hated Senator Farr enough to kill him?

87
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,984
What?

88
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:32,659
l'll need to find out
who wanted to hurt Senator Farr.

89
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:37,080
Actually, "kill him" would be more
accurate, what with him being dead.

90
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:41,001
No one wanted him dead.
Everyone loved him.

91
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,881
Well, that's obviously not true,
or l wouldn't be here, and he would.

92
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:50,177
Lieutenant. Even Ono's political enemies
respected him.

93
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,180
We need time to deal with this situation.

94
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,057
Time. Time. There's no time for time!

95
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,685
A murderer is on the loose,
and it's my job to find him!

96
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,228
Now if l were a guy
who committed senator-cide...

97
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,690
What makes you think it was murder?

98
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,820
Poison, of course!
The politicians' preferred method.

99
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,823
Found a chemical in his bloodstream,
killed him right away.

100
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,200
lt's an obvious case.

101
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:17,329
Politicians always have something to hide,
and it always comes back to haunt them.

102
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,332
Am l right?

103
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:26,087
Look who l'm asking.
Room full of politicians. Huh.

104
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,593
So, one of Farr's secrets
must have resurfaced.

105
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,222
Ono had no secrets. That's not it.

106
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:40,101
Perhaps someone was upset about
the clone-troop bill currently on the floor.

107
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,895
lt's very controversial.

108
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,649
Thank you, Senator... Amidala, is it?

109
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:50,070
But l already have my theory and
l'll follow my hunch, if you don't mind.

110
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,240
After all, l am the inspector,
you're the senator,

111
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:57,619
so l'll handle the inspecting,
and you can stick to the senating.

112
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,791
Good day.

113
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:08,630
Murder? lt's inconceivable.

114
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,842
Who would wish Onaconda harm?

115
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,429
What if it's the bill?
What if we're all being targeted?

116
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:20,100
Speculation gets us nowhere.
There is work to do.

117
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:24,479
We should double our efforts on the vote.
lt will be even harder with Ono gone.

118
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:29,359
- No. No, we should delay the vote.
- But why?

119
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,653
No one will give the vote
their full attention

120
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,239
until they know what's happened to Ono.

121
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:37,659
Well, maybe l can put a motion
on the floor.

122
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,662
l don't think anyone will object,
given the circumstances.

123
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,749
Good. Then we'll have time
to conduct our own investigation.

124
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:48,503
Detective Divo specifically asked us
not to interfere.

125
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,340
Well, he didn't exactly inspire confidence,
did he?

126
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,885
He didn't know Ono. We did.

127
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,016
We'll have a far easier time
looking into this than Detective Divo will.

128
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,185
Running around
could disrupt our coalition.

129
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,688
Yet you still seem determined
to see this through.

130
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,398
lndeed l am.

131
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:12,861
And l don't suppose you'd consider
bringing Captain Typho with you.

132
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,864
No, l'd rather do this quietly.

133
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,701
Then perhaps, Senator Organa,
you should accompany her.

134
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,747
- l think that's an excellent idea.
- l don't need a guardian.

135
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:27,417
Of course not, my dear.
Think of it as precautionary.

136
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:32,464
- Don't worry, l won't get in your way.
- Very well. l have no objections.

137
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,383
And l know exactly where to start.

138
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,981
You're suggesting one of us
killed Onaconda Farr.

139
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:54,110
- How delightful.
- l don't find any of this amusing.

140
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,695
Neither do l.

141
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,907
Every time Ono opened
his befuddled mouth,

142
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,494
it gave us another quote
to use in our fundraising.

143
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,289
Why would we kill
our best source of income?

144
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,875
You both opposed Ono's ideas
in the Senate.

145
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:14,130
With enough at stake, maybe
you decided to silence his voice for good.

146
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:19,260
Onaconda and l were often at odds,
but l respected him.

147
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,222
l respected him greatly.

148
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:27,227
For the record,
l had no respect for Onaconda whatsoever.

149
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,815
Ono had a secret meeting at the docks
under the derrick major

150
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,525
the night before he died.

151
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,861
And you just happened to know
about this meeting how?

152
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:42,992
Oh, l was having Ono followed.
Just because l respected Ono

153
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,454
doesn't mean
l wasn't trying to get dirt on him.

154
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,708
- Of course.
- The point is,

155
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,962
a clandestine, off-the-books meeting
under cover of darkness,

156
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,590
perhaps that location holds some clue.

157
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:03,805
Fine. l will go look. But whatever we find,
l'll have more questions for both of you.

158
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,239
Have l said that l think
we're very far out of our element here?

159
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:25,243
Yes, Bail, l believe you mentioned it
once or twice.

160
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,970
You know, using this investigation
to bury your grief

161
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,222
- might not be the best way to...
- l'm not.

162
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,519
Then why can't you just leave it
to Lieutenant Divo?

163
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,866
Padmé!

164
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,159
Wait! Watch out!

165
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,638
Hey!

166
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:41,462
Senator Amidala, is it possible
you might be going deaf?

167
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,590
- Lieutenant?
- Because when l said

168
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:47,176
l didn't want you to interfere
with my investigation,

169
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,513
l can only assume that you didn't hear me.

170
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,057
l had some information about a lead
here at the docks.

171
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,977
Which you naturally
brought to me straightaway

172
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,354
so l could investigate, only...

173
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,693
No, wait, you did the exact opposite
of that! There are rules, Senator.

174
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,697
My friend was murdered.
l don't care about rules.

175
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,326
Don't care about rules?

176
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:16,331
My dear, without rules, there's only chaos.
Everyone must care about rules.

177
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,874
We know that.

178
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,418
But now you've alerted the killer
that you're on to him.

179
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,087
And my investigation is that much harder.

180
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,590
Do you have any idea
how many reports l'll have to file now?

181
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:30,011
- We alerted the killer.
- Yes. That's what l'm saying.

182
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,847
What if we were sent here on purpose?

183
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,682
- To the docks?
- Yes!

184
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,310
What if this was all a setup?

185
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,688
What if Deechi sent us here
just so he could kill us?

186
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,857
lf we hurry,
we might still be able to catch Deechi

187
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,817
- before he leaves the Senate.
- Agreed.

188
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:50,907
But wait! l'm still investigating! This is
still an active crime scene! You can't...

189
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,533
Oh, fine.

190
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:02,502
Senator Deechi, l'm sure you're surprised
to see me after what you...

191
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,463
- He's dead.
- He's been stabbed.

192
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:09,050
This is definitely gonna require
another report.

193
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,558
The killer is obviously
targeting the leadership.

194
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,144
You must stay here under my protection.

195
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,189
Why? So the killer can
take us all out at once?

196
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,441
Oh, that's preposterous.

197
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,986
Even if the killer
did get through my security,

198
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,072
it's very unlikely that all of you
would end up dead.

199
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:34,450
We're far too easy a target sitting here.
l'm leaving.

200
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:40,289
No, you can't leave, Lolo. l think,
in this instance, the inspector is right.

201
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,292
Out of my way.

202
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,424
Who else knew
you were going to the docks?

203
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:54,137
Just Senator Burtoni. She was
the only other one in the room with us.

204
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,097
Burtoni, eh?

205
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,441
Sir, Senator Burtoni is not here.

206
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:11,446
Oh. Looks like that long-necked Kaminoan
has flown the coop.

207
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,786
lt's been a difficult time.
You've handled yourself well.

208
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,830
l had to try.

209
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:25,626
Ono believed if you see injustice,
you can't wait for someone else to fix it.

210
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,213
- You must stand up and get involved.
- He did.

211
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:36,637
Help! l have been attacked!
She's over there! She tried to kill me!

212
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,975
- What happened?
- Senator Burtoni. She jumped me!

213
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:45,480
- She's in the East Wing corridor! Hurry!
- Guards! Go!

214
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,615
You're insane. l didn't kill anyone.

215
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:59,327
Last thing l remember,
l was walking to my office.

216
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:04,874
- Then l woke up here.
- Senator Lolo has a very different story.

217
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,337
- She says you attacked her.
- Attacked her? Lolo?

218
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:18,346
lf l ever attack someone, l hope
it'll be someone mildly important.

219
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,641
Someone like Senator Farr?

220
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:26,312
Ono was a harmless bug.
l wouldn't bother killing him.

221
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,689
And Deechi was my ally.

222
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,860
l've been thinking about how
you were in Senator Amidala's office

223
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:36,739
- right before Farr died.
- So what?

224
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,368
And l've been thinking about
how you were in Deechi's office

225
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:45,581
to hear about that meeting at the docks.
A meeting l think Farr had with you.

226
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,377
lt wasn't me! You have no proof!

227
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,674
No? l have this.

228
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:58,719
l ordered an extensive forensic report
on Farr as soon as he died.

229
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:02,849
The poison which killed Farr
only affects Rodian blood.

230
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,977
And it was developed
by Kaminoan scientists.

231
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:10,148
But that's... l didn't kill him!

232
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,151
You're Kaminoan,
you had access to the poison.

233
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,154
That's motive, means
and opportunity. Guards!

234
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,701
But the scan must be wrong.

235
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:25,705
lf the poison was in all our drinks,
Lolo would have died, too.

236
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,832
- What?
- She's Rodian.

237
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,919
She'd have been poisoned, too.
Unless she didn't drink.

238
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,922
But you drank, right, Lolo?

239
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,595
Lolo. You didn't drink, did you?

240
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,557
You're right.
l should have pretended to drink.

241
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,269
All right, you're coming with me
for insurance.

242
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,440
Why did you kill Ono?

243
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:57,778
- He brought war to my planet.
- No! He made a mistake, Lolo.

244
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:02,450
Which everyone seemed to forget,
including you. l didn't.

245
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:06,412
Did you honestly think
he had the moral right to lead us?

246
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,122
After he betrayed us?

247
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:11,417
- He was sorry.
- He was weak.

248
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:15,463
We needed someone with strength
to stand against this war.

249
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:19,383
l tried to scare him at the docks, but
he wouldn't go away. So l removed him.

250
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,139
And when l heard Deechi knew
about that meeting, he had to go, too.

251
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,266
Halt! Put down your weapon.

252
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,412
<i>With the final votes tallied,</i>

253
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:52,458
<i>let it be known that the motion to stop
the creation of more clone troops</i>

254
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,834
<i>has failed,</i>

255
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,755
<i>and the continued manufacturing
of clone troopers</i>

256
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,132
<i>shall proceed as scheduled.</i>

257
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,103
After all that, we lost.

258
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,690
l know this decision was most unexpected.

259
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:20,903
l myself don't support it,
but democracy must stand.

260
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,698
Of course. You are right, Chancellor.

261
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:28,577
Hmm. Actually, given recent events,
perhaps it is for the best.

262
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:33,332
For how can we justify fortifying
our security here in the Senate

263
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:37,545
if we don't also provide reinforcements
on the front lines?

264
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:43,050
You see, the victory of the clone army,
for now,

265
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,429
is the only thing that can lead us to peace.
