1
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,061
<i>Calm before the storm!</i>

2
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,439
<i>A rare and welcome respite
from endless battle</i>

3
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,692
<i>awaits Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker
and Mace Windu</i>

4
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:30,571
<i>as they travel through deep space
aboard the Jedi Cruiser Endurance.</i>

5
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,906
<i>Preparing to rendezvous
with a Republic frigate,</i>

6
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:37,619
<i>the Jedi remain unaware of a deadly peril
lying hidden in their midst.</i>

7
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,290
War does not come with a guarantee.

8
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,961
No soldier gets the promise of safety,
survival, or victory.

9
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,590
But men, l guarantee you this:

10
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,928
Every member of this Clone Youth Brigade
will have his moment.

11
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:58,557
And it is that moment
when you are no longer a cadet,

12
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,477
you are a soldier.

13
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,980
There's the Jedi Cruiser.

14
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,649
You have the best training in the galaxy,

15
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,820
but no one can train you for the moment
you look death in the eyes.

16
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,657
What you do then,
and the soldier you become,

17
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,452
that is up to you.

18
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,956
Docking procedures begin shortly.
Until then,

19
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,833
dismissed!

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,558
- Who's the new guy with the long hair?
- Some last-minute replacement.

21
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,977
Looks green to me.

22
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,318
- Hey. What outfit you from?
-322nd.

23
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,404
- l heard they had their tour.
- They did.

24
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,532
l... l couldn't make it.

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,283
Broken arm.

26
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,037
A real trooper could lose an arm,
and still report for duty.

27
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,539
So what are you, soft?

28
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:07,209
- What's going on here, gentlemen?
- Just having a little fun.

29
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,587
Oh, l've seen your kind of fun, Hotshot.
Stand down.

30
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,508
Come on, Whip.
Air's getting stale around here.

31
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,387
- Hey. What's your name?
- l'm Lucky.

32
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,682
- Jax.
- Thanks, but l can handle myself.

33
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:25,936
Yeah, sure, but a trooper's only as strong
as the trooper beside him.

34
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,522
- We're all in it together, right?
- Right.

35
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,567
And with the training we got,
l feel ready for anything.

36
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,722
Oh!

37
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,518
Man!

38
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,910
Don't be nervous. Only thing
between us and them is experience.

39
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,953
lt's not like they're Jedi.

40
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,378
Morning, troops.

41
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,215
Welcome aboard
the Jedi Cruiser <i>Endurance</i>.

42
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:41,178
- l am Mace Windu. And this is...
- Anakin Skywalker. Welcome aboard.

43
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:45,098
Today, you'll see how a real,
working Jedi Cruiser operates.

44
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:48,936
And you'll have the chance to serve
right alongside two Jedi Knights.

45
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,647
- Serious? No way!
- That's gonna be awesome!

46
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,106
Jedi? Yeah!
Can you believe it?

47
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:57,152
Generals, new orders from General Kenobi
await you in the War Room. lmmediately.

48
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,322
Another time, then.

49
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,409
Wow!

50
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,494
The other guy's
Anakin Skywalker.

51
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,662
No way!

52
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,831
l heard he's the strongest Jedi.
This is going to be the best!

53
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,921
You seem more disappointed
than our cadets.

54
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:20,509
- lt's ourjob to instruct and inspire.
- You just wanted to show off.

55
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:25,055
Hey, when l show off,
it is instructive, and inspiring.

56
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,598
For you, maybe.

57
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:40,112
Looks easy, doesn't it?
Well, looks can be deceiving.

58
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,949
There's nothing more dangerous
in all of space than a moving target.

59
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:47,411
- What do you use for targets, sir?
- Malfunctioning droids.

60
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,874
Mechanical skeet, packed with explosives.

61
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,211
Now, this is my ship, and my rules.

62
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,965
l do not allow tourists on board.
Only soldiers.

63
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,718
Now, time for target practice.

64
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,220
You, there. Take the gun.

65
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,995
- Not even close. Next!
- But l only...

66
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,165
Oh, no, you're done.
You only get one chance.

67
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,793
l promise you,
the Separatists don't give more. Next!

68
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,393
Near-miss is still a miss, kid.

69
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,272
The Sergeant's right.
Training is no match for experience.

70
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,941
And it's the one thing none of you have.

71
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,113
l know that look.

72
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:18,877
Whoo-hoo!

73
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,170
Yeah!

74
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,049
l see why they call you "Lucky."

75
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:28,303
But let's see how you are when Seppies
come at you in tri-attack formation.

76
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,150
- Yeah!
- All right, all right, cut the chatter, men.

77
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,237
We're due on observation deck 13.
Fall out!

78
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,159
Now that's a cadet to watch.

79
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:56,748
Cadet 1151, tell me where this
Jedi Cruiser's main stabilizers are located.

80
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:00,335
Sir, hull 17, behind the main reactors, sir.

81
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,713
Good. Cadet 1174,

82
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,008
how many engines fail
before auxiliary power kicks in?

83
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,220
Sir, three on port and starboard sides, sir!

84
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:22,858
Channel 7 open,
ready to receive Code 5 transmission.

85
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,195
- <i>Boba, is that you?</i>
- lt is.

86
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,864
<i>l'm sending you the data now.</i>

87
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,082
Received transmission. Boba out.

88
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:44,921
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Uh, communiquÃ©, sir, eyes only.

89
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,883
l've been dispatched
to General Windu's quarters.

90
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:52,554
- There's no problem, sir.
- Oh, there's a problem. You're lying.

91
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,272
Admit it. You're lost.

92
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:07,569
Come on, cut the kid a break.
Windu's quarters are that way, shiny.

93
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,779
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

94
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,786
- Eyes on where you're headed, cadet.
- Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

95
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:20,809
Cadet 327, what reaction propels
the main engines of this Jedi Cruiser?

96
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:24,104
Pulse combines sparking off
the reactor core rods, sir.

97
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,814
Hmm. Excellent.

98
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:33,029
Sir. General Skywalker
requests your presence on the bridge.

99
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,781
l'll be there shortly.

100
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:41,371
The General requests
your presence immediately, sir.

101
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,875
No rest for the weary.
Put these inside my quarters, would you?

102
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,961
Yes, sir.

103
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,355
Are you all right? Trooper! Trooper!

104
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,778
This doesn't look like a drill.

105
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,909
No time for chatter.
There's been an explosion.

106
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:23,204
Let's show these troops how the Clone
Youth Brigade rises to the challenge.

107
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:27,417
Line up! Two by! l don't want any heroes.

108
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:31,004
Ourjob's to get to the nearest safe room
and let these troops do theirjob.

109
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,380
Now, move!

110
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:37,886
- Think it's a Seppie attack?
- Out here? Perfect place for it.

111
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,555
You heard the Sergeant!
Secure the loose talk!

112
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,771
- Status report, trooper.
- Ship's undamaged, one man down.

113
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,190
General Windu's quarters got hit
but he survived.

114
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,233
Survived?

115
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:04,245
- You're lucky to be alive. And our trooper?
- Dead.

116
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,208
- This was no accident.
- Agreed.

117
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,252
Keep moving!

118
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,981
Ship's navigation is nearby.

119
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,943
Admiral, has the navigation
been damaged?

120
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,947
Hobbled, not destroyed.
Systems are repairable.

121
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:42,909
l've ordered shutdown of all engines
until we're fully operational.

122
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,619
We'll hold orbit over Vanqor.

123
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,456
- Any sign of attack ships?
- None, but we'll keep scanning.

124
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:52,669
Until we get navigation back,
the <i>Endurance</i> is a fat and easy target.

125
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,963
l won't have it. Kilian out.

126
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:01,052
lf navigation wasn't the target,
then hitting your quarters was intentional.

127
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:11,896
Watcher, this is Boba. lt's a miss.
Repeat, miss. What should l do?

128
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,524
<i>Head to the reactor. Blow the core.</i>

129
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,403
But the crew!
lt isn't about them, just Mace.

130
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,990
<i>lfyou want Windu dead,
do as l say!</i>

131
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:28,329
We have a killer on board this ship
and we are locked in dead space.

132
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,831
Just like our assassin.

133
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,835
We'll form an unbroken line of troopers
and scour the ship from bow to stern,

134
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,171
checking every corridor,
bulkhead and storage unit.

135
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,840
l want him alive.

136
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,567
Hey, you there! Come here!

137
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,570
l got lost, sir.

138
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:05,825
- Ship's on full lockdown, son.
- Yes, sir, l know, sir. l just...

139
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,454
- l'll return to my company.
- Not alone, you won't.

140
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,707
Emergency protocol's in effect.

141
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,126
Look, l'm calling a trooper
to escort you out of here.

142
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,337
This is CT-1477, l need an escort
for a cadet back to his group.

143
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:22,175
- ls that a DC-15A?
- Yeah. Here. Keep the safety on.

144
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,011
<i>Copy that, CT-1477.</i>

145
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,972
<i>We're pretty overloaded
with the emergency status,</i>

146
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,808
<i>we'll get someone there
as soon as possible.</i>

147
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,059
What?

148
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,731
What are you doing?

149
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,901
We're brothers! Don't shoot!

150
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,655
- You're not my brother.
- Don't shoot!

151
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,281
Don't worry...

152
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,662
<i>CT-1477, report in.</i>

153
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:55,667
<i>CT-1477,
why have you broken off transmission?</i>

154
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,309
Our sweep has now covered
over half the ship, Admiral.

155
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,687
Still no sign of the assassin.

156
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,773
The more ground we cover,
the less there is in which to hide.

157
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,719
Huh. More action
than you signed on for, eh, boys?

158
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,221
- We're headed for the safe room now, sir.
- Fine, fine.

159
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,933
Although, on second thought,
let's make a drill of it.

160
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,685
Head for the pods.

161
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,645
Escape pods? Things must be bad.

162
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:01,900
- The escape pods, sir?
- Mmm. l want to see what they're made of.

163
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,484
l'll even time you.

164
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,030
lt'll all make a fine story
when you return to your base.

165
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,532
- This can't be happening.
- Get a hold of yourself.

166
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,702
Prepare to launch the distress beacon.
We're going down.

167
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,835
Get your men out of here!
There's nothing more you can do.

168
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,755
Artoo, prep the fighters,
be ready to take off.

169
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,854
- Lucky! Stay with the group!
- Yes, sir.

170
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,655
- How are we gonna get through this?
- Groups of four, men. Groups of four.

171
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,948
Take pods one and two.

172
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,991
Set rendezvous coordinates
with the other pods,

173
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,535
at a safe distance from the cruiser.

174
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,705
See you at rendezvous mark six.

175
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,125
This is the moment, men. Make it yours.

176
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,432
The pod's malfunctioned!

177
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,395
The main reactor's beyond hope.
You have to abandon ship.

178
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,524
No. You must abandon ship. l'm staying.

179
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,324
- We missed the rendezvous!
- l can't stop it!

180
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,871
l'm staying with the Admiral.
You better evacuate.

181
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,166
Admiral, you must abandon ship.

182
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:46,879
- Not a chance.
- But, sir, with respect, that's an order.

183
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,133
lt may be your command, General,
but it's my ship.

184
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,343
We don't have time
for that kind of sentiment!

185
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:56,806
lt's not sentiment!
An Admiral must go down with his ship.

186
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,059
l don't expect you to understand it, Jedi.

187
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,107
We're lost.

188
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,527
What happened? Do we still have control?

189
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,990
Navigation's shot. Looks like
our pod was damaged in the escape.

190
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,993
- Can we steer?
- No.

191
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:21,622
- How about fuel?
- No feed. We're dead weight.

192
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,543
- So what do we do?
- Ourjobs.

193
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,674
Get ready to attach the hyperspace rings.

194
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,313
Admiral, what's your status?

195
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,732
<i>We're caught
in Vanqor's gravitational pull.</i>

196
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,155
We're going to try to set her down
on the surface.

197
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,245
All right. Once you're down, we'll get
the rescue teams to your location.

198
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,997
<i>General Skywalker,
this is Sergeant Crasher.</i>

199
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,165
Yes, Sergeant.

200
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,128
lt's the cadets, sir.
l can't raise them on any channel,

201
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:13,508
and their locator beacon's not active.
Theirs is the only pod unaccounted for.

202
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,678
Sounds like our saboteur
may have gotten to the cadets.

203
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,806
We have to find that pod.

204
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,856
- What was that?
- l don't know. A ship, l think.

205
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,824
- Rescue ship?
- lt's too early.

206
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,700
What, then?

207
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,380
Well, what do we have here?

208
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,679
You boys look lost.

209
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:05,268
Congratulations, Boba. Job well done.

210
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:10,273
- His name's not Boba. He's Lucky.
- "Lucky"?

211
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,901
That's a good one.

212
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,279
You're with her?

213
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,115
l wasn't expecting you
to bring friends along.

214
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,910
l couldn't help it, Aurra.
What are you going to do with them?

215
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,873
- What do you think?
- Let them go?

216
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,418
They're living witnesses, honey.

217
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,630
That was never part of the plan!

218
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,592
l just wanted to kill the Jedi
that murdered my father.

219
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,302
Well, that will have to wait.

220
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,305
Grow up! You'll get your revenge in time.

221
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,602
Now get on board.
We have to get out of here.

222
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,854
Or, you can go with your friends,

223
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,565
who l'm going to jettison into the unknown.

224
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,985
That would be poetic.

225
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,115
l'm sorry.

226
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,203
Traitor.

227
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,795
Do it!

228
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,216
You'll regret this!

229
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,735
l can't believe it.
A traitor? He was a traitor?

230
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,404
Yes, well,
we can't worry about that right now.

231
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,240
We have to find a way
to contact somebody.

232
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,743
We already tried! This pod is dead!

233
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,204
- We only have minimal life support.
- Yeah?

234
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,831
Well, whose fault is that? None of us!

235
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,668
That guy you defended left us for dead!

236
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,003
Stow it, Whiplash!
We need to work together.

237
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,172
You're not in charge here!

238
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,343
They have come back to finish us off!

239
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,553
No, wait! lt's the Jedi!

240
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,143
l found your missing cadets, Crasher.

241
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,646
<i>Nice work, General.
How are they?</i>

242
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,606
l can't raise them on the comm channel.

243
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,942
Their pod must have been damaged
in the evacuation.

244
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,945
<i>Head to point 038
and you can pick them up.</i>

245
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,154
Right away, sir.

246
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,116
Skywalker, have you heard
from Admiral Kilian?

247
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,619
No, l lost contact
when they entered the atmosphere.

248
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:37,962
- Jax, l'm sorry. l lost my head. l didn't...
- lt's okay, l understand.

249
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,632
l can't believe it was one of us,
someone just like us.

250
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:47,096
- He's nothing like us!
- Let's hope he is. lf he is like us,

251
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,932
he'll realize he's wrong.
