1
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:22,104
<i>War creates opportunities
for the criminal underworld!</i>

2
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,149
<i>Ruthless mercenaries conspire
with the Separatists</i>

3
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:29,319
<i>to disrupt and exploit
the unstable situation within the Republic.</i>

4
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,114
<i>Now, Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano</i>

5
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,658
<i>descend into the treacherous
gangster havens</i>

6
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,369
<i>in an effort to find a corrupt
and vile arms dealer</i>

7
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,621
<i>who is buying weapons
on the black market</i>

8
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,458
<i>and selling them
to the Republic's enemies.</i>

9
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,476
Car Affa is an arms dealer selling
Republic weapons on the black market.

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,936
- Who is he selling them to?
- The Separatists.

11
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,857
According to intelligence,
he's inside this joint.

12
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,943
You stay here in case he tries to escape.

13
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,820
Just like always.

14
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,171
Hey!

15
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,427
My lightsaber.

16
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,723
Hey!

17
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,521
My master's gonna kill me.

18
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,030
This isn't happening.

19
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,786
- Where were you?
- l...

20
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,873
l was checking out a suspect.
l had a bad feeling about him.

21
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,377
- And?
- lt was nothing. False alarm.

22
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,379
Well, come on, then.

23
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,229
Master?

24
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,441
ls it all right if l go to the library
and do some research?

25
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,986
Sure. l'll take care of our little friend here.

26
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:44,746
l'm sure if you explain your loss
to your master, he'll understand.

27
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:51,295
No. He tells me over and over,
"Your lightsaber is your life. Don't lose it."

28
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,841
There has to be a better way
to find this thief.

29
00:02:55,925 --> 00:03:00,012
l'm sorry.
Pickpockets aren't my field of expertise.

30
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,764
At this rate, it'll take me years to find him.

31
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,602
l might have another idea. There.

32
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:11,023
That is Tera Sinube. He's an elder Jedi.

33
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:16,278
He happens to be an expert
on the Coruscant crime world.

34
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,614
- l think he's sleeping.
- Yes.

35
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,659
Well, he will be able to help you.

36
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:26,371
Uh, pardon me, Master Sinube?

37
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,040
What? Who?

38
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,294
l was just resting my eyes.

39
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:37,966
- Hello, Master Sinube.
- Good morning, Jocasta.

40
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,637
l don't know you, do l?

41
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,140
My name is Ahsoka Tano.
l was told you could help me.

42
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:50,062
- Help you? Mmm?
- l'll leave you two to your business.

43
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,815
A thief stole my lightsaber,
and l only got a quick look at him.

44
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,902
l could tell he definitely came
from one of the aquatic planets.

45
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,695
You know, one of the water worlds.

46
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:03,408
So you're saying
there was something fishy about him?

47
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:13,669
Well, let's try and see if we can find out
where he went, shall we?

48
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,589
We were near the slum district, G17.

49
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,718
Where would he go, your little pickpocket?

50
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:26,515
To a gangster hangout?
Unlikely, but possible.

51
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:30,435
Maybe the gun market
to sell the lightsaber.

52
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,731
Within the radius.
Just a moment, let me see.

53
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:38,235
He was a Patrolian. That's a fish guy.

54
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,320
Maybe...

55
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,073
ls it one of these fishes?

56
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,201
- That's him!
- lnteresting indeed.

57
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:51,123
According to the file,
his name is Bannamu, a petty thief.

58
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,375
He hangs out in the slum district.

59
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,793
Thank you, Master Sinube.

60
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,045
- l'm sure...
- Your help has been invaluable.

61
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,381
- Well, you're welcome.
- lf there's anything l can do...

62
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:04,094
Yes, there is.
l haven't been on assignment in years.

63
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,306
And if you don't slow down,

64
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,726
you're not going to find
what you're looking for.

65
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,602
l'll come with you.

66
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:17,441
Okay, gramps.
lt would be nice to have company.

67
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,984
Splendid!

68
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,084
Can l help you?

69
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,504
We're looking
to buy a lightsaber.

70
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,757
Any ideas where we could do that?

71
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,259
Come with me.

72
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:57,856
So, you wanna buy a lightsaber?
How much are you willing to pay?

73
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,776
lf you have it, you'll give it to me.

74
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,488
What my little friend is saying
is how much?

75
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:08,283
- Twenty thousand.
- Twenty thousand?

76
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,495
lt's a rare weapon, a Jedi weapon.

77
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:17,459
- Do you have the item with you?
- No. But l can get it.

78
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,213
- From him?
- Hey, who are these guys?

79
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,801
- They are Jedi!
- And if we are?

80
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,303
l don't want to get mixed up with Jedi.

81
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,972
We were just doing our old friend
Bannamu a favor.

82
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:35,227
Well, l think it's time you forget about him
and do me a favor.

83
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,312
That's my lightsaber he stole.

84
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,233
Well, that makes a difference.

85
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,693
What do you want me to do?

86
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,363
l want you to tell me where he is.

87
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:51,576
l hope you remember this
and someday do me a favor.

88
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:56,081
He's not that far away.
He's at the Spider Arms Hostel.

89
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,887
- May l help you?
- We know where we're going.

90
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,558
You know where you are going.

91
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,019
We must be careful
not to warn him.

92
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,730
But, Master, we don't know
where we're going.

93
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:24,192
He could be
in any one of these rooms.

94
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,780
- You need to be more quiet, young one.
- Okay, okay.

95
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:33,410
Not quiet with your mouth.
Quiet with your mind.

96
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:39,374
You're so anxious to find this pickpocket
that your worry is equal to his.

97
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,255
You mean, if l relax,
l can sense Bannamu's anxiety?

98
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:51,052
Yes. lf you relax,
you would realize he's in this room.

99
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,436
Well, well, Bannamu, l assume.

100
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,731
Who are you? What do you want? Hey!

101
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:07,110
My lightsaber, you slimy thief.
l want it back. Now!

102
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:12,782
l no have it! l swear! l got rid of it!

103
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:17,037
l almost killed myself with that thing.

104
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,914
- What did you do with it?
- No, no.

105
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,790
l don't recall.

106
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,043
- You little...
- Ahsoka!

107
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,964
lt's not smart to steal from a Jedi.

108
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,843
You're looking a little too young
to be a Jedi.

109
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,265
Come on! Okay, okay, okay.

110
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:41,937
His name is Movers, yes, Nack Movers.

111
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,481
Nack Movers?

112
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:48,652
He's a very dangerous one,
well-known in the underworld.

113
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:53,615
Yes! Exactly! Yeah, l sell it to him.
Yeah, yeah.

114
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,326
You should be afraid.

115
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,580
l got a good price.
He was very, very motivated.

116
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,832
You can find him with his girlfriend.

117
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,295
She has a place
on the upper east side of Happyland.

118
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,965
l bet he's there now. He's always there.

119
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:13,635
- You can stop talking now.
- Okay, l shut up.

120
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,846
Well, at least you know
where your lightsaber is.

121
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:21,518
Yeah. lt's in the hands of a killer.
This is exactly what l was afraid of.

122
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,818
- Master, we've got to hurry.
- Patience, young one.

123
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:34,322
You worry that if people die
at the hands of your lightsaber,

124
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:39,869
that you will be as guilty for their death
as the one that strikes the blow.

125
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:46,334
A valid concern, young one,
and one for you to puzzle out.

126
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,839
What? What is it?

127
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,593
l believe we've reached our destination.

128
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,015
Oh, no.

129
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:06,187
- Let me guess. Nack Movers.
- A reasonable assumption.

130
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,689
He's dead.

131
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,195
- Are they gone?
- Who's gone?

132
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,156
The men who killed Nack.

133
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,370
- Who are you?
- lone Marcy.

134
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,539
l came home and found him here like this.

135
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,543
lone, did you call for help?
Why were you hiding?

136
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,795
l was afraid.

137
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,428
She seems terrified.

138
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,392
And yet,
l sense something else is troubling her.

139
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,144
l'll search the other rooms.

140
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,628
Time to die!

141
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,923
- How does this work?
- My lightsaber!

142
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,675
You're a Jedi?

143
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,120
Master Sinube, you're right.

144
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,789
l found the intruder
and she has my lightsaber.

145
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,793
She's a Terellian jango jumper
and hard to keep up with.

146
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,296
So the assailant is a female?

147
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,830
Aha! That's it!

148
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:46,723
l am sure my little friend
will catch up to your intruder.

149
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,683
You have nothing to worry about.

150
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,271
Right. Of course.

151
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:09,287
Your friend Nack
wasn't a very good fighter, was he?

152
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,332
- Or maybe he was poisoned?
- What?

153
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:16,503
Well, obviously,
he's come to an unfortunate end.

154
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:20,757
He'd be stronger than the average man,
though, wouldn't you say?

155
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,676
l guess.

156
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,804
Hmm.

157
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,817
You said a group of men
killed your friend Nack Movers.

158
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:43,446
And yet, my Padawan
described the assailant as a female.

159
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,658
There was a group of them.
l didn't get a good look.

160
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,662
l also contacted the authorities
to come here

161
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,540
and help you with your unfortunate friend.

162
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,291
Oh.

163
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,669
You're very kind.

164
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,630
</i>l have no doubt</i>

165
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,966
<i>the Jedi are doing their very best</i>

166
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:49,012
<i>to ensure the safety of every citizen
in the Republic.</i>

167
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,934
<i>The accusations
that the Jedi created the Clone War</i>

168
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:59,147
<i>to give themselves more power
over the government is absurd,</i>

169
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,649
<i>and l will not stand for it.</i>

170
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,861
You should have a seat.

171
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,615
You might have been distraught before,

172
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:12,577
but ever since the intruder
left your apartment,

173
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,163
you've become even more nervous.

174
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:21,002
l'm upset. This whole ordeal
l just endured, it's upsetting.

175
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,589
<i>...Count Dooku
and his droid armies.</i>

176
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:30,178
<i>To support the Jedi's efforts in the war,
l ask the Senate to pass these new laws</i>

177
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:34,182
<i>giving more jurisdiction
to planetary security.</i>

178
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,775
Or is there a reason
you might be concerned?

179
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,869
You weren't afraid
because you were in danger.

180
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:59,499
You were afraid we would find your friend
hiding in the other room.

181
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,834
You're in league with the bounty hunter!

182
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,798
Arrest her!

183
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:16,432
Off she goes. Always rushing.

184
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:20,436
Cassie, the Jedi know l'm involved.
l had to run.

185
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,064
Just get over to J Street and pick me up.

186
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:11,487
- l see you've learned patience, young one.
- Where did you get that speeder?

187
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:15,783
l asked one of the police droids
to lend me some transportation.

188
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,661
They were kind enough to oblige.

189
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:33,217
Hey! You're driving too slow.
We need to go faster.

190
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:37,263
Patience. We'll cut them off
at the train station.

191
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,599
How do you know they're headed there?

192
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:45,188
Did l mention l planted a tracking
device on lone, the girl that ran away?

193
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:46,939
No.

194
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,072
Stop them!

195
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,036
Halt. Halt. You're under arrest.

196
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:11,107
You ran off in such a hurry.
l trust you didn't mean to be rude.

197
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,484
l have nothing more to say to you, Jedi.

198
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:17,488
Well, perhaps you meant
to be a little rude.

199
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:45,057
You're trapped. Surrender now
and turn the lightsaber over to me.

200
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,934
Don't tell me what to do.

201
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,062
l've got a lightsaber,
and l'm as powerful as a Jedi.

202
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,030
l'll trade myself for them.

203
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:03,576
You know how much l'm worth to the Jedi.
lt's a good deal.

204
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:07,622
All you have to do is let them go.

205
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,046
Once we're alone, you'd use
some kind of Jedi Force trick on me.

206
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,924
No deal. These two stay with me.

207
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,384
And you, you stay out of my way.

208
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,992
For a guy that moves slow,
you always seem to get ahead of me.

209
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:51,165
The value of moving slowly is that
one can always clearly see the way ahead.

210
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:13,521
Well, l best be getting back
to my master before he misses me.

211
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:18,401
Certainly. But first,
l need one last favor from you.

212
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:23,114
- Sure. Name it.
- Pass on what you have learned.

213
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,750
- Hello, old friend.
- Greetings, Master Sinube.

214
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:38,504
Padawan Tano,
a lesson you have for us today, hmm?

215
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,841
- Yes.
- A lesson in patience.

216
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:46,095
Gather round, younglings.
Listen to the Padawan, you shall.

217
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:53,227
This weapon is your life,
but it is also your responsibility.

218
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,731
Don't let it out of your sight.
