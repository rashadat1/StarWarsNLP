1
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,519
<i>Diabolical defeat!</i>

2
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:23,147
<i>Though Republic victories
outnumber their losses,</i>

3
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:27,651
<i>the Jedi have been unable to stop
Separatist advances in the Outer Rim.</i>

4
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:32,489
<i>The ever-elusive General Grievous
stays one step ahead of his opponents.</i>

5
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,200
<i>With thousands of droid armies
at his command,</i>

6
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:38,787
<i>the Jedi can never predict
where Grievous will strike next,</i>

7
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,247
<i>until now.</i>

8
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,624
Stand by! Grievous is boarding.

9
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,222
- Status report.
- There's too many of them!

10
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,559
Get yourselves to the escape pods.
l will deal with Grievous here.

11
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,394
<i>But, sir, they're commando droids!</i>

12
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,855
That does not matter, Captain. Now go!

13
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,755
Jedi.

14
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,673
Grievous.

15
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:13,215
Eeth Koth, isn't it?
l've been looking forward to meeting you.

16
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,930
Your reputation precedes you, General.

17
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,933
The reputation
of a coward and a murderer.

18
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,566
Murderer? ls it murder
to rid the galaxy of you Jedi filth?

19
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:22,784
<i>Greetings, Jedi. lt would seem once again
one of your order has lost his way,</i>

20
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:28,040
<i>and, even better,
a leading member of your Jedi Council.</i>

21
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:33,128
<i>Listen to me, Jedi.
l do not care about your politics,</i>

22
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,131
<i>l do not care about your Republic,</i>

23
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:39,801
<i>l only live to see you die!</i>

24
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,393
<i>But death will not come so easily
for Master Koth.</i>

25
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,812
<i>l will make him suffer endlessly,</i>

26
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,316
<i>because l know
that is more painful for you all!</i>

27
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,409
Away with the younglings.
Much there is to discuss.

28
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,749
lt's time somebody finally put an end
to that monster.

29
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:16,338
On that, agreed we are.
How to find him, the question remains.

30
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:22,177
After engaging Grievous,
we lost contact with Master Koth.

31
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,345
He could be anywhere.

32
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:27,266
Commander Wolffe has found a message
in the holo-transmission.

33
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,517
Play back the message.

34
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,315
Look, hand signals.

35
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,528
l admit my skills are rusty, but...

36
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:46,827
"Saleucami system, Sector J-19,

37
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:52,582
"zero-eight, zero-five, two-nine."

38
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:57,504
Saleucami? But intelligence reported
Grievous has no ships near that sector.

39
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:02,592
Yes, but so often inaccurate
our intelligence is.

40
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,595
- l shall go.
- So will l.

41
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,722
And l.

42
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,408
Are you ready?

43
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,162
Ready and waiting.

44
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,747
<i>l shall engage the Separatist fleet</i>

45
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,416
<i>and send you the coordinates
of Grievous' command ship.</i>

46
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,086
- Just make sure you get it right.
- <i>l always do.</i>

47
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,089
How do you plan on getting Grievous
aboard your ship?

48
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,426
<i>Not to worry,
the good general and l have a history.</i>

49
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,137
<i>l'm sure he'll want to even the score
face to face.</i>

50
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,932
Meanwhile, we'll jump in undetected
and board the command ship.

51
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,478
lf Master Koth is still alive,
we will find him.

52
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,772
<i>Hopefully, by the end of this mission,</i>

53
00:05:56,814 --> 00:06:00,734
<i>we will have saved Master Koth
and captured General Grievous.</i>

54
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:20,003
Sir, we have entered
the Saleucami system.

55
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:27,427
- Begin preparations for our landing.
- Yes, my lord.

56
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,182
Sir, there are several ships
coming out of hyperspace.

57
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,643
Are they Republic or Separatist?

58
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:42,192
Republic.
Three cruiser class, four escort class.

59
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,781
You see? Your compassionate friends
have come to rescue you.

60
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,534
Just as l knew they would.

61
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,555
One of the Republic ships
is hailing us, my lord.

62
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,390
Put him through.

63
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,521
<i>General.
l knew one day l'd catch up to you.</i>

64
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:25,944
Kenobi! What a surprise. l assume
you are here to bring me to justice?

65
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:29,448
- <i>You know me too well.</i>
- lndeed l do!

66
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:34,369
Prepare to fire all cannons, and be alert.
Where there is Kenobi,

67
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,789
you will always find Skywalker
not far behind.

68
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:44,713
The enemy ships are faster and
more maneuverable. l suggest caution.

69
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:50,218
Draw them in. l want to board that vessel.
l shall kill Kenobi face to face.

70
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,518
Well, we certainly have his attention.

71
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:02,898
Admiral Yularen, keep Grievous' fleet
occupied so Anakin's arrival is undetected.

72
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:09,821
Yes, General.
Commence attack! All ships fire at will!

73
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,742
Yes, sir! We're moving in.

74
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,337
Commander Cody, do you have the exact
coordinates of the command ship yet?

75
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,922
We are patching them through now, sir.

76
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,760
We are receiving the coordinates
from General Kenobi.

77
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:35,263
How close are you going to jump in
next to Grievous' ship?

78
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,475
Pretty close. Buckle up, boys.

79
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:42,521
- Define "pretty close."
- Close enough to get the job done.

80
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,699
Get me a tractor beam lock on Kenobi's
ship and prepare a boarding party!

81
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,499
Tractor beam has us, sir.
Shall we fire on the source?

82
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:07,212
No, Cody. Let them think they have us.
We need the diversion for Anakin.

83
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,842
We're coming out of hyperspace. Hang on!

84
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,150
Primary power down.

85
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,328
So, was that close enough for you?

86
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,164
Any closer
and we'd be flying down hallways.

87
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,416
Ah, next time.

88
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,306
- Coast is clear, Rex.
- Copy that, sir.

89
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:04,352
Stay here and guard the entrance.
This may be our only way out.

90
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:08,189
Skywalker, Master Koth is located
on the bridge. This way.

91
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:23,413
Remember, we need to keep Grievous on
this ship until General Skywalker is clear.

92
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,511
Look out!

93
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,905
Kenobi.

94
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,783
- How are we doing?
- We are close.

95
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,928
So, Kenobi, is everything
going as planned?

96
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,098
That depends
on your point of view, General.

97
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:34,776
You wouldn't come here without a plan.
And you wouldn't come alone.

98
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,738
Tell me, do you think Skywalker
has rescued Master Koth yet?

99
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,795
- Surprise.
- Not exactly.

100
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,141
Well, at least they're not destroyer droids.

101
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:12,647
The General's description of your tactics
have been 100% accurate today.

102
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,151
Very impressive, even by my standards.

103
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:33,126
Your plans
have come to ruination, Jedi.

104
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,004
l hear a lot of talking, General.

105
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,299
But in the final accounting,
what does all the talk get you?

106
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,886
A futile quest for power, a mutilated body

107
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,764
and your place as Dooku's errand boy.

108
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:51,352
l'm no errand boy.
l am not in this war for Dooku's politics.

109
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:56,274
l am the leader of the most powerful
droid army the galaxy has ever seen.

110
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:04,949
An army with no loyalty, no spirit.
Just programming.

111
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,453
What have you to show for all your power?
What have you to gain?

112
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:13,041
The future.
A future where there are no Jedi.

113
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,554
The story of Obi-Wan Kenobi ends here.

114
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,405
One more step and your friend will die.

115
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,159
Ha, ha, ha.

116
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,927
No!

117
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:26,072
Your friends shall die, Kenobi,
and you shall soon follow.

118
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,622
Got to get it.

119
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,210
Behind you!

120
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,643
Uh...

121
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,528
l see you got my message.
Where's Grievous?

122
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,782
lf everything's gone according to plan,
he's onboard Obi-Wan's ship.

123
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,200
He's been captured?

124
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,245
lf we can cut off his escape,
there's a good chance of that.

125
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,347
- Surrender, General.
- Never!

126
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,023
Anakin! l hope
you've rescued Master Koth,

127
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,734
<i>because Grievous is headed
back to his ship.</i>

128
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:48,780
You both go.
l'll make it back. l'll be fine.

129
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,074
l'll have to disagree with you on that one.

130
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:54,827
Master Gallia, you go ahead.
l'll get Eeth back to the shuttle.

131
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,789
May the Force be with you.

132
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,504
Get back to the bridge. We need to detach
before Grievous jumps ship.

133
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,800
- <i>Cody, come in!</i>
- Yes, sir.

134
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,760
<i>Grievous is headed your way.</i>

135
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,853
Open fire on the Republic ship.
Target their engines!

136
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,523
But, sir, the ships are still attached.

137
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:27,402
lt doesn't matter. Prepare all troops
for our landing on Saleucami.

138
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:48,798
The circuits are fried. We have no controls.
l can't even get the engines online.

139
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,541
- We've lost our stabilizers!
- l can't hold her steady!

140
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,822
Until we meet again, Kenobi!

141
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,782
Hurry! We can still catch him!

142
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:41,327
Obi-Wan, Anakin's leaving.
We'll be trapped on the ship.

143
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,832
Anakin, come in.

144
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,463
<i>We're in a bit of a spot
and we need a way off of Grievous' ship.</i>

145
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:56,634
There's a large hangar near your position.
Make your way there and l'll pick you up.

146
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:03,766
<i>All droids to the landing craft.</i>

147
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,309
Hey!

148
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,075
Get to your stations,
we're going to detach.

149
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,458
Prepare to launch.

150
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,723
The reactor's been breached.
l can't lock it down!

151
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,032
Here we go!

152
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,928
Anakin, get me Admiral Yularen.

153
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:28,309
Several craft detached from Grievous' ship
and attempted to land on Saleucami.

154
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,603
Then we'll have to land and follow them.

155
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,480
- Prepare the tanks.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

156
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:37,068
There must be several landing sites.
lt may be hard to locate the good general.

157
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:40,696
You'll have to command the space battle
while Rex, Cody and l head to the surface.

158
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,615
You sure you can handle this on your own?

159
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,533
l think l can manage.

160
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,017
l'll get Master Koth to a medical frigate.

161
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,939
- You all took a great risk rescuing me.
- You're welcome, Master Koth.

162
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,901
Since you divided your forces,
Grievous is still at large.

163
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,195
l would have gladly given my life

164
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,906
if it meant bringing that monster
to justice.

165
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:27,410
Well, at least we all live
to fight another day.
