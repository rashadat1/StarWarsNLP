1
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,394
<i>Stolen secrets!</i>

2
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:24,440
<i>Villainous mercenary Cad Bane
was hired by Darth Sidious</i>

3
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:28,110
<i>to steal a holocron
from the vaults of the Jedi Temple.</i>

4
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,195
<i>After fleeing the scene of the crime,</i>

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,365
<i>Bane hunted down
and captured Master Bolla Ropal,</i>

6
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,119
<i>who has a crystal which holds secrets
of the Jedi Order.</i>

7
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,123
<i>As a Separatist fleet arrives
to help the bounty hunter,</i>

8
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:44,126
<i>Anakin Skywalker races in
to cut off their escape</i>

9
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,629
<i>and stop Bane
from delivering the stolen holocron.</i>

10
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,968
- l guess we're going down with the ship.
- Roger, roger.

11
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,475
General, we're receiving
an urgent transmission from the planet.

12
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,817
<i>General Skywalker,
our base has been overrun!</i>

13
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,652
<i>There's no possibility of evacuation!</i>

14
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,323
<i>They've taken General Ropal
and the holocron memory crystal.</i>

15
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,327
Do you know where they've taken them?

16
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:22,331
<i>Sorry, sir. We tried to stop them,
but they left the outpost.</i>

17
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,835
Wait a second.
There's too much interference.

18
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,338
Transmitter's been destroyed
at the source, sir.

19
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,840
We have to find out
what ship Master Ropal is on.

20
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,198
You will remain conscious, Master Jedi.

21
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,409
The bounty hunter
has some questions for you.

22
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:04,248
Attach mind limiters, pain pulsers
and give him a full dose of X-C33.

23
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:15,759
Sir, that Republic ship has destroyed
our escort and is blocking our escape.

24
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,428
Whoever's commanding that cruiser
is a bold one.

25
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:22,224
Move us out of the battle zone
and prepare to jump to hyperspace.

26
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,852
l have a small favor to ask our Jedi guest.

27
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,860
General, a Separatist command ship
is fleeing the battle.

28
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,739
You think they have Master Ropal
on board as a prisoner?

29
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,074
l'm sure of it.

30
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,161
Admiral, intercept them
before they can jump to hyperspace.

31
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:46,123
- l'll ready the troops for boarding.
- Boarding? We have no boarding craft.

32
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,334
We were prepared to land on the planet,
not aboard another ship.

33
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:53,463
- You can't be serious.
- l am, Admiral. Thank you for your opinion.

34
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,924
Now, target their hyperdrive.
We don't want them getting away.

35
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,605
Sir! Captain!

36
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,734
Sir, they hit the power converters
so we can't go into hyperspace.

37
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,278
Hmm. l wonder what the Jedi are planning.

38
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,034
l've rounded up three brigades, sir.
Where are we going?

39
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,369
We're going to board a Separatist frigate,

40
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,623
rescue Master Ropal
and recover an archive holocron.

41
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:31,668
We have no assault craft, sir.
Only a couple of fighters and The Twilight.

42
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,671
Waiting for orders, sir.

43
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,715
And the plan is?

44
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,342
Just curious.

45
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:46,642
l came down to see if l could be
of any help, General Skywalker.

46
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:50,145
Actually, you can.
Activate those walkers, Admiral.

47
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:56,318
You are not thinking of using those
to transport the clones to that frigate.

48
00:03:56,402 --> 00:04:01,823
- Well, they are pressurized.
- And they're equipped with magnetic feet.

49
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:06,495
- Hmm. Good call.
- Master, you're a genius.

50
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,331
Those walkers are designed for terrain,
not space.

51
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,584
Rex, load them up. Let's go, Snips.

52
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:18,674
Execute Battalion, take AT-AT 300!
Carnivore Battalion, Walker 773! Let's go!

53
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,309
Simply open this little box of yours,

54
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,020
so l can get the information
from this crystal,

55
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,690
and your suffering will come to an end.

56
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:41,655
You will never get me
to unlock the holocron.

57
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,575
Unfortunately, l don't have time
to discuss this with you.

58
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,786
Hit him again, full power.

59
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,334
l'm not sure
how much more of this he can take.

60
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,671
- Are you a medical droid?
- No, sir.

61
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,632
- Then step back and shut up.
- Roger, roger.

62
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,175
More power.

63
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,398
- We've lost all his vital signs.
- Check.

64
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,987
- He is no longer functioning.
- Drop him.

65
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,413
He's dead.

66
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,499
Looks like we will have to find
another Jedi to open this holocron.

67
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,669
Only next time,
l will try a different method.

68
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:11,286
<i>When Darth Sidious asked me
to loan you the Federation fleet,</i>

69
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,705
<i>he didn't say you were going to war!</i>

70
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,292
<i>Bane, you have already lost
four of my ships.</i>

71
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,544
<i>l hope you can pay for all of this.</i>

72
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:24,341
One authentic Jedi holocron
and the memory crystal l was after.

73
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,218
When my benefactor gets this,

74
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,346
he will compensate you
for your puny fleet.

75
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,975
Sounds like the Jedi want it back.

76
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,832
The Jedi are overwhelming
our vulture droids.

77
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,668
- Should we send out reinforcements?
- No.

78
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,212
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
- Did you say, "No"?

79
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,589
- Mmm-hmm.
- Roger, roger.

80
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,552
<i>The Jedi will board the ship
and get the holocron back!</i>

81
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,430
<i>Transmit the information
and close the deal immediately!</i>

82
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:15,684
l can't. Only a Jedi can access the device.

83
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:20,021
Fortunately, there are two Jedi
on their way to help me.

84
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,691
One more than we need for our purposes.

85
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:26,611
<i>You'd better live through this.
l want my money, Bane.</i>

86
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,280
You can count on it.

87
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,369
Artoo!

88
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,465
Wipe all the frigate's memory banks
and destroy every record of our mission.

89
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,717
lnitiate the self-destruct sequence.

90
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,386
You, transfer all ship functions
to my wrist com.

91
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,056
l want control of doors,
gravity generators, everything.

92
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,183
Roger, roger.

93
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,435
The rest of you,
stay here and defend the bridge.

94
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,355
We're defending the bridge alone?
Against the Jedi?

95
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,065
l hate this job.

96
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,252
Don't shoot! l'm not the commander.
He's the commander!

97
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,757
Guess l'm the commander now.

98
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,427
Artoo, see if you can find Master Ropal.

99
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:38,433
<i>One authentic Jedi holocron
and the memory crystal l was after.</i>

100
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,436
Oh, no. He has both pieces now.

101
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,980
Rex, send a squad,
lock down the hangar bay

102
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,108
and destroy all the escape pods.
No one gets off this ship!

103
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,944
Yes, sir.

104
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,155
Artoo, you have to find Master Ropal.
Hurry!

105
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,533
What was that?

106
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,293
General Skywalker, one of the engines
on that frigate has exploded.

107
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,629
l caution you to avoid the aft section.

108
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,924
- How much damage is there?
- <i>l suggest immediate evacuation.</i>

109
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,093
Not until we get what we came for.

110
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,055
Spread out. While you take on the clones,

111
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,559
l will separate the Jedi
and lead one of them away.

112
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,901
Master, l found him!

113
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:37,033
Rex, have some men
take Master Ropal back to the Resolute.

114
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,620
We might not be able to find
the holocron in time, Master.

115
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,541
But if it's destroyed with the ship,
Nute Gunray won't get it either.

116
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,420
Maybe, but l'd rather
return it to the library personally.

117
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,425
Come on, Artoo.

118
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,346
Artoo says we're close. Stay sharp.

119
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,766
Ow!

120
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,184
Switch to night vision.

121
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,531
There!

122
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,879
Welcome, Jedi. We've been expecting you.

123
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,174
Kill them!

124
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,558
Let's make this a bit more interesting.

125
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,770
Lockdown!

126
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,610
Magnetics! You were trained for this!

127
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,827
Artoo, turn the gravity generators
back on!

128
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,899
Check your fire! Hit one of those shells
and this fight is over for all of us!

129
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,574
l'll get him, Master!

130
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,536
Ahsoka, wait! lt's a trap!

131
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,250
Ahsoka, wait! We'll take him together!

132
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,177
Whoops!

133
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,900
You thought you could get away?

134
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:01,070
You're not much of a challenge, youngling.
l got you right where l want you.

135
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:03,948
Ow!

136
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,793
l'm not impressed.

137
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:40,068
General Skywalker, can you hear me?
Are you all right in there?

138
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,862
Yeah, l'm all right. Get back to the hangar.

139
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,698
Find a transport,
but wait for us as long as you can.

140
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,075
We're on it, sir.

141
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,743
Ahsoka, do you copy?

142
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,422
There's a power surge
heading toward the bridge.

143
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:05,009
lf you're there, get out immediately.
You must abandon your mission.

144
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,887
l don't have the holocron memory

145
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,099
and l seem to have misplaced
my Padawan.

146
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,434
The ship is tearing itself apart!

147
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:17,146
Move off to a safe distance, Admiral,
and await my signal for evacuation.

148
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:21,484
Of all the Jedi,
why did l have to end up with Skywalker?

149
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,655
Oh, l wouldn't do that.

150
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,616
Those binders have been
specially designed for Jedi.

151
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,787
The more you struggle,
the tighter they get.

152
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,457
- lmpressed now, youngling?
- Not really.

153
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,594
Enjoy this while you can, <i>sleemo.</i>

154
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,847
This burning boat
is about to finish us both off.

155
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,348
We have time.

156
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,935
The bond between a Jedi teacher
and his apprentice is strong.

157
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,647
Which means my Master
will be coming for me any minute.

158
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,028
Let's see if we can get him here any faster.

159
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,162
You said we'd be safe back here.

160
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,956
Come on,
there's three of us and only one of him.

161
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,166
lt won't matter.

162
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,464
Sir, a Jedi is coming.
He looks very unhappy.

163
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,387
Your Master has gotten the message.

164
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,603
You have nowhere left to run,
bounty hunter.

165
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,023
Let me worry about that, Jedi.

166
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,692
lf l activate this control,

167
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,571
the outside airlock will open
and she will be sucked into oblivion.

168
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,365
Do you think you can kill me
and then save her

169
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,867
before she's pulled out into space?

170
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,119
lt's a horrible way to die.

171
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,625
Besides, isn't negotiation the Jedi way?

172
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,129
What do you want?

173
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,675
This holocron carries information
l've been paid to collect.

174
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,678
l can't unlock it, but you can.

175
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,181
The last Jedi who had it wouldn't open it.

176
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,850
l hope you don't make the same mistake.

177
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:25,608
We don't have much time.
Hurry it up, Jedi, or she dies!

178
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:32,448
- No, Master! Don't do it!
- l can't let you die, Ahsoka.

179
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,200
Master, no!

180
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,916
- We'll deal with the holocron later.
- How touching.

181
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,922
All units make for that shuttle!

182
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,708
Captain, the main reactor is exposed.
lt will implode at any moment.

183
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,962
Yes, sir. We're trying to make our way
to the shuttle now.

184
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,298
- Get out of there!
- <i>Sir! Yes, sir.</i>

185
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,133
You two find the General and help him!

186
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,802
This frigate's not going to last.
We have to get out of here!

187
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:35,970
Yes, sir!

188
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,309
Come about. We need to put some
distance between us and that frigate.

189
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,000
Now l will combine this holocron

190
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:10,088
with the memory crystal
l acquired from your dead Jedi friend.

191
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,972
My employers will be most pleased.

192
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:56,092
- <i>Bane, did the Jedi cooperate with you?</i>
- With some encouragement.

193
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,844
l have access to the holocron

194
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,221
and all the information
the memory contains.

195
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,390
l only have to get off this ship.

196
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:08,229
<i>Maybe you should transmit it to me now.
Then l can send another ship for you.</i>

197
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:12,441
No thanks, Viceroy.
l have a plan for my own escape.

198
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:23,286
Hold it right there!
You're not going anywhere, bounty hunter.

199
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,083
Rex, l hope you found us
a ride off this bucket!

200
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:32,378
We've got to leave now.
The reactor's gonna blow. We cannot wait!

201
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,173
You'll have to.
l'm going after that bounty hunter.

202
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,759
Master, wait! Stop!

203
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,930
This is the way to the hangar!
We must get off the ship now!

204
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:47,894
- l can't let Bane get away.
- Patience, Master.

205
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,645
Patience.

206
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,315
You're right.

207
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,966
Come on, come on!

208
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:31,312
- Trooper, did you get the holocron?
- No, sir.

209
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,107
- l'll get it, Master.
- No time. Rex, get us out of here.

210
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,500
Well, it looks like
the holocron was destroyed,

211
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,002
but at least the Separatists didn't get it.

212
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,965
Bane's dead, but l can still feel him.

213
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:18,693
Master, l'm sorry
l let that mercenary get the upper hand.

214
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:23,531
lt wasn't your fault, Ahsoka.
lt was mine, start to finish.

215
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:32,206
So, did you manage
to recover the holocron

216
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,542
or capture the bounty hunter?

217
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,545
Um, no and no.

218
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,880
l see.

219
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:44,719
So the mission was
your usual version of success, then?

220
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,056
lf by success you mean, "l won," then yes.
