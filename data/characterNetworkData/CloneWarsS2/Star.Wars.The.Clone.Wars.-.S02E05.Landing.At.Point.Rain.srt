1
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,601
<i>Counterattack!</i>

2
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,103
<i>With the clone army stretched</i>

3
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:24,314
<i>in a desperate attempt
to engage General Grievous' starfleet,</i>

4
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,734
<i>Separatist planets
that were once thought secure</i>

5
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:29,486
<i>are now rising up against the Republic.</i>

6
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:32,656
<i>On Geonosis,
Separatist leader Poggle the Lesser,</i>

7
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:37,619
<i>safe in his newly ray-shielded factories,
creates thousands of terrible new weapons</i>

8
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:41,248
<i>which march off the assembly line
against the outnumbered clone army.</i>

9
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,295
<i>The Jedi, resolute in their effort
to restore order to the Republic,</i>

10
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,381
<i>mount a massive invasion
to retake Geonosis</i>

11
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:53,218
<i>and shut down Poggle's factories of terror
once and for all.</i>

12
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,140
l cannot believe we're back here again.

13
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,767
lt is unfortunate.

14
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:03,645
The resistance from the native Geonosians
was stronger than we anticipated.

15
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,732
The same can be said
for their loyalty to Count Dooku.

16
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,984
A fact that is often overlooked.

17
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,444
You're late.

18
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:14,448
Sorry, Master, Ahsoka and l were
busy routing the Seppies near Dorin.

19
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,326
My squadron alone had 55 kills.

20
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,329
Yeah, but mine had 76.

21
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,663
Showoff.

22
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,124
Well, l'm glad you two are
enjoying yourselves.

23
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,585
Hey, it's just a little
friendly competition, Master,

24
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,836
nothing to worry about.

25
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,173
What l worry about is the way
this war seems to be drawing out

26
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,300
with no end in sight.

27
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:37,429
Which is why it is crucial our invasion
of Geonosis meets with success.

28
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,766
Agreed. Ahsoka,
contact the Outer Rim Command.

29
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,184
We're ready for our briefing.

30
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,977
They're already waiting for us.

31
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,438
Our ships are in position

32
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,608
and we are ready to begin our campaign
against the Geonosians.

33
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,820
<i>And what about Poggle?
Any report on his location?</i>

34
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:56,657
lt seems he's holed up
at the primary droid foundry here.

35
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,201
The factory is protected
by a shield generator.

36
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,412
Anakin, Ki-Adi and l
shall attempt a three-pronged attack

37
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:06,208
through their defense lines
to a staging area just short of the shield.

38
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,128
Once we've landed,
we shall knock out the shield generator.

39
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,255
That is our primary target.

40
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:15,384
<i>lsn't it risky committing three generals
to one area of the attack?</i>

41
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,388
<i>lf something went wrong,
we could be dealt a serious blow.</i>

42
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,641
<i>To ensure that rise again
Geonosis does not,</i>

43
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,309
<i>capture Poggle we must.</i>

44
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:29,815
Of course. As always, l shall leave
the strategy to you, Master Jedi.

45
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,650
Our thanks, Chancellor.

46
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,569
<i>May the Force be with you.</i>

47
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,782
Good. Cody, these are the coordinates
for the rendezvous.

48
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,994
Yes, sir, when we hit the ground,
we'll create a perimeter there.

49
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,872
Getting past their defenses here
will be the trick.

50
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,833
General Mundi will come across
the defensive lines from the north.

51
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,169
We will make our assault
through the middle.

52
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:54,756
General Skywalker will make his attack
on the defensive lines from the south,

53
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:59,011
and we'll meet at the rendezvous point
at 0700 exactly.

54
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,470
lf we meet with strong resistance

55
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,598
and are forced down
away from the landing zone,

56
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,768
hold out until we join our forces
before attacking the shield generator.

57
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,146
Their frontlines are heavily fortified.

58
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:12,274
Look at that giant wall
with all the gun emplacements.

59
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,610
That won't be easy to get past.

60
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,945
Don't worry.
We're not going anywhere near that.

61
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:20,908
Come, now. What happened
to all the enthusiasm l saw earlier?

62
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,451
Don't worry about us.

63
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,662
You just make sure you get yourself
to that landing zone in one piece.

64
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,957
Yes, l shall be waiting for you,
when you finally arrive.

65
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,753
<i>Gentlemen, if you are quite finished,
we have a battle to begin.</i>

66
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,755
Quite right.

67
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,424
Cody, prep the gunships.
l'll meet you in the hangar.

68
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,800
Yes, sir.

69
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,492
No, sir, l wasn't involved
in the first assault on Geonosis.

70
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,828
Well, you didn't miss much.
Last time, l was chained to a pole

71
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,498
and attacked
by several humongous monsters.

72
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,377
- That sounds entertaining.
- lt was,

73
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,670
for the Geonosians.

74
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,255
- We all ready, Rex?
- Yes, sir.

75
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,090
General Kenobi is already underway.

76
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,718
Well, he's got a head start.
We'll have to catch up.

77
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,015
Good luck, General.

78
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,018
There is no such thing as luck.

79
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,741
Good thing those bugs can't aim.

80
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,763
The flak is too heavy.

81
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,265
<i>We're down! Repeat, down!
Location five...</i>

82
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,560
l just lost contact with Skywalker's team.

83
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,938
Come on!
Get up, we have to keep moving!

84
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,902
Here they come!

85
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,029
Watch it! Watch it!

86
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,206
They're falling back! Come on!

87
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,256
Get the tanks on the ground! Now!

88
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,762
Cody, get the tanks down.
Come in, Cody!

89
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:35,018
<i>Cody, come in! Get the tanks down!</i>

90
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,771
Copy that. Pilot, begin landing sequence.

91
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,898
Copy that, Commander.
Have fun down there.

92
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,201
Move it! Move it!

93
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,161
Here they come!
Bugs incoming!

94
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,704
Man down! Man down!

95
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,998
General Kenobi, don't land!
The zone is hot!

96
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,335
But there's nowhere else to go!

97
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,719
We're hit! We're going down!

98
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,851
Brace yourselves!

99
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,489
- Bogie, point three five.
- l'm on it, leader.

100
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,285
Nice work.

101
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,581
What are our losses, Captain?

102
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,374
We got hit pretty hard.

103
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,627
l think only Kenobi's forces made it
through the flak to the landing zone.

104
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,212
And what about Skywalker?

105
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,632
Captain Rex reported
they're still in the middle of a firefight.

106
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,217
Skywalker's tanks are gone

107
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,304
and they're trying to contact
General Kenobi's forces for support.

108
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,431
ln the meantime, they'll press on
to the rendezvous point.

109
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,101
Very well. Load the injured onto the tanks.

110
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,353
We'll make for that ridge.

111
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,397
With any luck,
we can meet up with Skywalker

112
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,357
on his way to Kenobi's position.

113
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,866
Okay, Cody,
l'll speak with General Skywalker.

114
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,411
Rex, what's the word?
Can Obi-Wan send support or not?

115
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,621
l don't think so, sir.

116
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,081
Cody says General Kenobi never reached
the landing site.

117
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,833
They think his gunship got shot down.

118
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,794
Great. The one time
l actually ask Obi-Wan for help,

119
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,004
he's nowhere to be found!

120
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,465
Well, what if something happened
to General Kenobi?

121
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,842
- He could be injured or...
- No time for that kind of talk.

122
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,345
Rex, we need to mobilize, now!

123
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,764
Get the men together.
We're going to rush the guns.

124
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,015
Yes, sir.

125
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,683
Ahsoka, you're with me.

126
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,644
We need to give Rex cover
when we attack.

127
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,729
Got it, just give the word.

128
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,773
Hey, l'm worried about him, too,

129
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,067
but you have to keep your mind
in the here and now,

130
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,694
otherwise we'll never be able
to help Obi-Wan.

131
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,241
- All here, sir.
- Ready? Now!

132
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,535
Go, go, go, go! Take them out!
Take them all out!

133
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,252
Not good. The bugs are splitting up.

134
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,879
- Boil, reporting as ordered sir.
- Waxer, reporting as ordered sir.

135
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,673
We've got a downed gunship
five clicks east.

136
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:10,924
We believe it's General Kenobi's.

137
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,218
l need you to get out there
and check for survivors.

138
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,886
- Sir, yes, sir!
- Sir, yes, sir!

139
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:33,029
- Why do we always get the fun missions?
- Oh, this isn't the fun part.

140
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,990
Getting back to the square is the fun part.

141
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:43,582
Waxer, Boil, am l glad to see you!
Trapper and l are the only ones still alive.

142
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,958
Good to see you, sir!

143
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,919
Commander Cody has established
the square just beyond this position.

144
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,755
The bugs are on the move
and trying to surround us as we speak, sir.

145
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,719
They've got the General.

146
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:59,472
AT-TE 636, lay down cover fire
at point three five.

147
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,650
Take it down! Take it down!

148
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:21,369
- Are you injured, General?
- No, no, nothing too serious.

149
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:25,206
- What's the situation here?
- We've got no air cover.

150
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,459
Two generals on the ground
beyond our position.

151
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,377
And a mess of bugs surrounding us.

152
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,921
The enemy was more than prepared
for our attack, sir.

153
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,757
They knew our every move.

154
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,384
Well, l'm sure General Skywalker
and General Mundi

155
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,927
will make it to our position.

156
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,389
We just have to make sure we're still here
when they arrive.

157
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,831
Negative, Captain. We will be unable
to provide any air support at this time.

158
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,583
l understand that, sir,

159
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,335
but we have three attack forces
on the ground

160
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,170
and only one at the landing zone.

161
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:17,175
This is a planetary-wide invasion, Captain.
lf l divert resources to your position,

162
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,928
it will mean sacrificing
other areas of the campaign.

163
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,348
<i>All we can do at this time
is help you find General Skywalker.</i>

164
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,434
All right, sir. l'll report to the General.
Commander Jet, out.

165
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,270
Give me every fighter you can scrape up.

166
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,399
Have you located
General Skywalker's position?

167
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,318
We think he's somewhere
along the eastern barrier.

168
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,154
That's not a barrier, it's a fortress.

169
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,122
Gentlemen, tackle...

170
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:53,169
Well, this is another fine mess
you've gotten us into.

171
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,588
What? Hey, it's not my fault!

172
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,841
You were supposed to study
the holomaps!

173
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,342
l did!

174
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,929
Remember when l reminded you
about the giant wall,

175
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:07,434
and you said, "Don't worry, Snips,
we won't be anywhere near that"?

176
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,477
Just get ready to climb!

177
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,481
General, l left a squad to protect the tanks.

178
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,234
Are you sure this is
the shortest way to the landing zone?

179
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:20,780
No, l'm not sure, Commander.
All l can do is trust my instincts.

180
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,005
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
l have a wing vibration up ahead.

181
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,780
Don't stop! We must push on! Forward!

182
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,867
- So, what's the plan, General?
- Just keep us covered, Rex.

183
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,453
There's too much laser fire
for all of us to make the climb.

184
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,956
Ahsoka and l will handle this.
Just be ready when that wall comes down.

185
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,006
How many droids
have you shut down so far?

186
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,802
- Twenty-five.
- Ah, you're falling behind. Let's go!

187
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,113
Focus on the droids on top of the wall!

188
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,454
Man down!

189
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,445
Look for a hatch. We need to put
the explosives inside the wall.

190
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,156
Found one!

191
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,223
Hey, did you get them?

192
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,100
- Catch!
- Huh?

193
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,852
No!

194
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,647
- Come on, Rex.
- Up and away!

195
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,904
Help!

196
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:13,429
- Next time, just tell me to jump.
- Now, where's the fun in that?

197
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:17,558
- Come on, we can't keep Obi-Wan waiting.
- You heard him, lads. Let's go!

198
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,780
We're almost through.
Bring in the flamethrowers!

199
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,542
Look! What's that?

200
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,511
<i>Master Mundi, do you read me?</i>

201
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,304
We're here, Skywalker.

202
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,725
We took a slight detour that put us
out of communications for a bit.

203
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,977
<i>This has been a day for detours, Master.</i>

204
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,396
lndeed, but now the road is clear.

205
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,649
l can see the landing zone.
lt does not look good.

206
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,110
Can you get me Admiral Yularen?

207
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,116
<i>Admiral, we're at the breaking point.</i>

208
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,076
<i>You've got to get some fighters
down here.</i>

209
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,621
You are in luck, General Skywalker.
l have one squadron available.

210
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,008
Retreat! Go! Go! Go!

211
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:43,061
Fire through! Make every shot
count! Give it all you got!

212
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,691
Reinforcements!
The reinforcements have arrived!

213
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:02,080
Go, go, go! Move it! Move it!
Hurry up, lads! Let's go!

214
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,418
Hurry! Hurry! Here they are.

215
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,045
Move it! Move it!

216
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,507
Master Kenobi!

217
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:17,678
- Well, what happened to you?
- l might ask you the same question.

218
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,682
Our combined forces should be enough
to destroy the shield generator.

219
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,269
Anakin, you'll need to take a small squad
through the shield,

220
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,189
as close as you can get
to their gun emplacements.

221
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,234
From there, you'll be able
to temporarily jam their scanners

222
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,112
so they are unable
to target the incoming tanks.

223
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,364
Once the tanks knock out the shield,

224
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:40,368
Master Mundi can bring
the rest of the troops in with the gunships.

225
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,994
Consider it done, Master.

226
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,546
All units are in position, sir.

227
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,674
Tell Skywalker to start the attack.

228
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,425
Begin the attack.

229
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,093
Let's jam their scanners.
Droid poppers, ready.

230
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:50,062
- Looks like it's working.
- lt won't last long. Bring up the tanks!

231
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,440
So, Master, what was your total?

232
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,236
- Not now, Ahsoka.
- Come on!

233
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,404
Are you afraid you lost this time?

234
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,491
Fine. Fifty-five, that's my count. And you?

235
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,912
Sixty. Looks like l won.

236
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,416
Yeah, but l called in the air strike. Tie!

237
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,502
You're impossible!

238
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,170
l'll never understand

239
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,757
how you can simplify these battles
into some kind of game.

240
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,596
Well, take care of yourselves.
l expect to see both of you back here

241
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,057
by the time l've destroyed
the main factory.

242
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,684
We shall do our best.

243
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,104
- Sixty-five, Skywalker.
- l'm sorry?

244
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,439
My total. Sixty-five.

245
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,400
So what do l win?

246
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,532
My everlasting respect, Master Mundi.

247
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,158
Oh.

248
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:30,371
That is a gift Anakin rarely bestows,
l assure you.
