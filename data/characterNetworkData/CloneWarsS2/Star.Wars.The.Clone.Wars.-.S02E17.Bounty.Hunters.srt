1
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,396
<i>The death toll rises!</i>

2
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,650
<i>As the battles intensify and threaten
a growing number of Republic worlds,</i>

3
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,736
<i>planets are left to survive on their own</i>

4
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,406
<i>while the Jedi struggle
to fight a war on many fronts.</i>

5
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,825
<i>A series of medical stations
have been established</i>

6
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:37,077
<i>as a lifeline for those in need.</i>

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,873
<i>But the facilities are easy prey
for Separatist attacks.</i>

8
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:44,543
<i>After losing contact
with the medical station orbiting Felucia,</i>

9
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:49,798
Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker
<i>and Ahsoka Tano are sent to investigate.</i>

10
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,928
That's Felucia, dead ahead.

11
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:58,307
But where's the medical station?
l don't see anything on my scanners.

12
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,684
Wait, there's something.

13
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,609
- Vulture droids.
- Hang on!

14
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,744
l guess we know what happened
to the medical station.

15
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,499
- That's not good!
- They took out the plasma conduit!

16
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:35,636
- You thinking what l'm thinking?
- Almost certainly not.

17
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,847
Looks like we're doing this the hard way.
Starting ejection sequence.

18
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,394
How come every time you fly, we crash?

19
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,189
lt's not my fault. lt's the ship.

20
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,110
Ready to eject.
Wait...

21
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,112
Now!

22
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,917
He always blames the ship.

23
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,351
- You all right there, Master?
- l'm fine, Anakin.

24
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,646
Where on Felucia do you think we are?

25
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,106
l'm not sure.

26
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:35,028
- l don't like the sound of that.
- And l don't like the look of that.

27
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,289
We don't want to scare them.

28
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,375
We can't just wander around aimlessly.
We need a plan.

29
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,504
You always taught me to go on instinct,
and my instincts tell me to go that way.

30
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:56,675
Well, that doesn't seem right.
l think we should go this way.

31
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,928
Why do you even ask for my
opinion? You never do things my way.

32
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,680
We crashed the ship your way.

33
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:05,684
Very funny. l see your sense of humor
survived the landing.

34
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:09,605
- lt's about the only thing.
- Uh, if you two are done arguing,

35
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,482
l think there's some smoke on the horizon.

36
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,652
Which means people,
and a way off this planet.

37
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,083
Look. There's a village.

38
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,211
Maybe they have a ship we can borrow.

39
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:47,643
- Hmm, they're growing healing herbs.
- Nysillim, l believe.

40
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,686
One of the most valuable crops
in the galaxy.

41
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,950
- This place looks deserted.
- l don't believe it is.

42
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,495
The crops are ready to be harvested.
Tools are lying about.

43
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,413
No, something's amiss.

44
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,124
Well, there's one thing l learned
where l grew up.

45
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,460
lf you want to know what a farmer's up to,

46
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,212
look in their barn.

47
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,095
This is an odd ship for farmers.

48
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,472
Perhaps someone's here
to pick up the sillim.

49
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,850
l still don't get it. Where is everyone?

50
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,209
- Mystery solved.
- They're terrified.

51
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,837
lt's okay, we won't hurt you.

52
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,758
Kindly drop your weapons, Jedi.

53
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:05,053
Take it easy, Snips.
We don't want any trouble.

54
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,891
lt's not always about the numbers.

55
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:15,480
Four on one is hardly a fair fight,
even for a Jedi.

56
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,818
Wait a minute, four on one?
You mean four on two.

57
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,738
We don't count you, knee-high.

58
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,240
Do you count me?

59
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:36,168
Stop! Don't harm them!
Can't you see these are Jedi?

60
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,587
- We are saved!
- Saved?

61
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,091
Need l remind you, Casiss,
you already made a deal with us?

62
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:48,138
- But with the Jedis' help...
- Excuse me, but help you with what?

63
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,974
Pirates.

64
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:59,441
Simply stated, if we don't give
the pirates a portion of our crop,

65
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:03,987
they will destroy our homes
with us in them.

66
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,323
Hmm, l see your dilemma.

67
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:11,244
Sillim farming is a meager trade.
Without our herbs to sell,

68
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:15,749
we will have no money for food,
fuel or equipment.

69
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,418
And yet you can afford
to pay mercenaries?

70
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:24,049
These bounty hunters drive a far more
reasonable bargain than the pirates.

71
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:28,220
- Why not just fight them yourselves?
- Easy for you, perhaps.

72
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,809
But look at us.
We are farmers, not warriors.

73
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:38,438
Even with the bounty hunters' help,
l had feared the worst.

74
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,941
But now, there are seven of you.

75
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,610
What do you want, Jedi?

76
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,697
We need a ship.
Ours is beyond repair, l'm afraid.

77
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,950
The one in the barn, that'll do.

78
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:54,162
That's our ride.
lt doesn't go anywhere without us.

79
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,331
And right now, we're busy.

80
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,291
Busy extorting farmers?

81
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,919
l don't hear you offering to help.

82
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:05,507
Unfortunately, we couldn't help
even if we wanted to.

83
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,008
What?

84
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:13,640
Master, these farmers are in trouble.
Why can't we help them?

85
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,518
Believe me, Ahsoka,
l would like nothing more.

86
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,896
However, we need to report that
the medical station has been destroyed.

87
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,106
lf we stay too long,

88
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,191
the Separatists will show up
looking for us here.

89
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,402
- But...
- Better they get robbed by pirates

90
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,696
than attract the interest
of General Grievous and his horde.

91
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,366
Pirates! Pirates, pirates!
The pirates are back!

92
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:44,671
That's far enough.
l speak for the people of this village.

93
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,008
State your name and business.

94
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:53,180
My name is my own business.
And my business is taking what's ours.

95
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,434
There is nothing here that's yours.
Unless you're here to buy it.

96
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,896
Buy it?

97
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,066
Kenobi. Skywalker!

98
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,361
l can't believe
you came all this way to see me.

99
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,989
- Hondo.
- Hondo.

100
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,367
- You know each other?
- Of course we do.

101
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,913
Tell them how far back we go, Kenobi.

102
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,998
Too far, l'm afraid.

103
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,585
And here l thought
we were friends.

104
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,046
lf you're truly interested
in friendship, Hondo,

105
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,132
might l suggest
you stop threatening these farmers?

106
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,884
Threatening them?

107
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:36,389
Oh, please tell me you have not been
listening to this bounty-hunting scum.

108
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:41,686
Scum? We're just here
to help them protect what's theirs.

109
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:46,233
Oh, come, come, my dear.
How much are they paying you?

110
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:50,362
Bububub! Does not matter.
Whatever it is, l will double it.

111
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,949
And all you have to do to earn it is, uh,

112
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:58,954
- step aside.
- We don't break deals.

113
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,545
- Steady, everyone.
- What is your stake, anyway, Kenobi?

114
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,881
All we want is a ride
to the nearest Republic outpost.

115
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,634
And l'm willing
to pay you handsomely for it.

116
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,803
Twice what you could make
selling this crop.

117
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,098
Well, um, how do you plan to pay me?

118
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,351
- A funds transfer when we arrive.
- Republic credit?

119
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:28,066
We've been over this before, Kenobi.
My associates don't accept that currency.

120
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,902
l'm offering a deal
that benefits us all, Hondo.

121
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,989
Don't let your greed blind you to that fact.

122
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,283
You know, l like you, Kenobi,

123
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:41,580
but no one leaves this planet
until l get my sillim.

124
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,332
Then l hope you enjoy it here,

125
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,586
because you'll be staying
a long time, parasite.

126
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,841
You know,
this crop has not been harvested.

127
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:58,680
You better hurry, old man,
before things start to die on you.

128
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,526
When the attack comes,
it will come from two fronts.

129
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,654
The forest to the south,
and the ridge to the north.

130
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,866
Whatever you do,
you must defend both sides.

131
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,118
But there are only four of them.

132
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,705
How can four bounty hunters
defend against so many?

133
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,378
The farmers are right.
These bounty hunters don't stand a chance.

134
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,339
We've been over this, Anakin.

135
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:36,217
You seem to lack confidence
in our abilities, young Jedi.

136
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:40,096
l'm sure you're good at what you do,
but you are in way too deep.

137
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,767
Said the peacekeeper
who fails to keep the peace.

138
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,061
The rift in the galaxy is not our fault.

139
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,230
lf more worlds would stand up
for themselves against the Separatists,

140
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,108
this war would have been over long ago.

141
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,779
That's it! We'll just train the villagers
to defend themselves.

142
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,448
But we are just simple farmers.

143
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,242
Why are we paying bounty hunters
to defend us

144
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:04,412
if we are just going to end up
doing it ourselves?

145
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:08,625
- Hush, Dilanni.
- Trust me. We'll have you ready.

146
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,095
Put it in the barn. Every bushel.

147
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,768
All right, everyone, form up.

148
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,604
Um...

149
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,982
Divide into rows of five.

150
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:42,117
l told you, we are not soldiers.
We don't even have weapons.

151
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,954
May l?

152
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,220
Yep, these will do.

153
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:09,185
What happens if you need the barn
as a fallback position?

154
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:12,397
With all the sillim here, it will be difficult
to squeeze the farmers in.

155
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,858
There's room.

156
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,736
l worry that you care more
for the safety of the sillim

157
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,988
than you do for the safety of the villagers.

158
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:24,075
You think l'm only worried about my profit.
ls that it?

159
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,202
The thought had crossed my mind.

160
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:30,665
So, in your mind,
l'm just like any other pirate.

161
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,254
- Am l wrong?
- Not entirely.

162
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:40,175
But it is easier to protect the villagers
and the sillim

163
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,511
- if they're both in the same place.
- Then might l suggest...

164
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,223
You might suggest anything you like,
General Kenobi.

165
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:51,186
But l know what l'm doing,
and l will keep these people safe,

166
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,854
my way.

167
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,714
Seripas! lt's too heavy!

168
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,473
Seripas?

169
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,937
Don't look!
l'm having a suit malfunction.

170
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:47,909
- Not very intimidating, am l?
- You don't have to look tough to be tough.

171
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,294
l thank you for your help.

172
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,199
The bounty hunter is right.

173
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:32,287
Every minute you waste
teaching us to twirl these stupid poles

174
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,957
is time you could have spent
beating those pirates yourself.

175
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,876
And what good would that do you?

176
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,795
Another band of brigands
would inevitably come along.

177
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,799
Or do you intend to give away
part of your crop every harvest season?

178
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,887
lf you make us do this,
there won't be another harvest season!

179
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:56,019
All right, everyone, get back in position.
Let's continue.

180
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:09,490
Well, what have we here?
Getting ready for a fight, are we?

181
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,872
There! A scout!

182
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,002
Embo!

183
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:56,913
Quick work.

184
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,041
Yes,

185
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:05,254
but when this scout fails to report
to Hondo, he'll be coming, soon.

186
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:15,682
The scout has not checked in
from the village. He's long overdue.

187
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:21,854
Well, well, well. So it looks like the Jedi
are getting involved, doesn't it?

188
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:26,734
Or, at least we now know
we can't take these villagers for granted.

189
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,530
But you know what l always say.
"Speak softly

190
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,324
"and drive a big tank."

191
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:41,541
The farmers are in position.
Well, the ones who stuck around, anyway.

192
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,335
Very well, Anakin. Turn on the fence.

193
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,758
Battle positions, everyone!

194
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,381
Embo!

195
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,845
Embo, can you hear me?

196
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,306
You'll be all right. We'll get you inside.

197
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,977
Everyone, fall back to the barn!

198
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:29,732
That tank is going to tear
the villagers apart.

199
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,532
Get him inside.
We'll hold them off as long as we can.

200
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,284
Die, Jedi scum!

201
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,151
- No!
- Sugi! Watch your flank!

202
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,431
Your situation is hopeless, Skywalker.

203
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:59,197
- Welcome back, Dilanni. Are you all right?
- Fine.

204
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,132
The Captain!

205
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,509
Let's go!

206
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,349
The day is won!

207
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,644
Help me!

208
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:36,525
Skywalker, let me call off my men.

209
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:58,047
This effort is no longer profitable!

210
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:13,854
There are crops to harvest,
fields to till, huts to rebuild.

211
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,691
Now, let's get to work.

212
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:22,029
How can l ever thank you
for saving our village?

213
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,533
We didn't save your village, Casiss.
Your people did.

214
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:31,163
For the first time in my memory,
my people don't have to be afraid.

215
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,125
We will never forget you.

216
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:40,339
l seem to find myself light on company.

217
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,384
Still need that ride
back to the Republic outpost?

218
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,637
lf it wouldn't be any inconvenience.

219
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:50,057
On the contrary, it would be my pleasure.
