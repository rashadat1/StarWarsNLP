1
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,854
<i>Desperate times call
for desperate measures!</i>

2
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:24,773
<i>ln one of the longest
and fiercest battles of the war,</i>

3
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,861
<i>Separatist forces are on the verge
of claiming the planet Malastare.</i>

4
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,946
<i>lf the Republic loses this planet,</i>

5
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:36,201
<i>it will cost them vital fuel resources
necessary for maintaining their armies.</i>

6
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,121
<i>ln a final effort
to turn the tide of this battle,</i>

7
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,957
<i>Supreme Chancellor Palpatine
has authorized</i>

8
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,295
<i>the use of the Republic's newest weapon,
the electro-proton bomb.</i>

9
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:51,467
<i>Now at the imperial palace of Doge Urus,
the leader of the Dugs,</i>

10
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,260
<i>the Jedi count down the minutes</i>

11
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,555
<i>until the detonation
of their doomsday device.</i>

12
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,109
That's a lot of clankers.

13
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:23,832
l won't allow my people
to become Separatist slaves.

14
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:27,002
<i>l assure you, Doge Urus,
that will not happen.</i>

15
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,295
<i>Dr. Boll has stated</i>

16
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:32,341
<i>that only droids will be affecTed
by the bomb's electron field.</i>

17
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:36,512
Yes. The clones and your people
will be quite safe.

18
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:39,640
We have accounted
for every probable outcome.

19
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:43,060
lt's the improbable
that concerns me, Doctor.

20
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,020
There must be other options.

21
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:50,192
<i>l'm afraid not.
This bomb is our only hope for vicTory now.</i>

22
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,153
The droids are on the move.

23
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,825
Go! Go!

24
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,541
We just need to hold them back
until the bomb drops.

25
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,216
Blast them!

26
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,147
Hold the line!

27
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,316
We've got fighters inbound!

28
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,245
Tell the bombers to take off.

29
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,376
Approaching drop zone.

30
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,257
Everyone, stay tight.

31
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,093
Remember,
you've only got one shot at this.

32
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,803
Bombs away.

33
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,687
Uh-oh.

34
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,098
Here it comes!

35
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,018
<i>l'm losing my transmission.</i>

36
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,367
Well, Doc, looks like it worked.

37
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,706
The ground is sinking.

38
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,212
Run for it!

39
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,758
The droid army was completely
neutralized by the bomb.

40
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:46,553
But the blast created a sinkhole
which engulfed many of our troopers.

41
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,722
We have search parties
looking for them now.

42
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,933
<i>And the Dugs?
Have they signed the treaty?</i>

43
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:56,271
No, Chancellor,
the treaty must be passed by the council.

44
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,065
<i>We need that treaty signed</i>

45
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:02,235
<i>so we can gain access
to the fuel reserves here on Malastare.</i>

46
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,155
<i>Without it, our armies shall be vulnerable.</i>

47
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,491
l will do my best.

48
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:13,830
Sir, we have a report from the front.
They've lost contact with the rescue team.

49
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,210
One problem
always seems to replace another.

50
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:29,137
l hope your bomb has not upset
the delicate balance of our planet.

51
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:44,361
You deal with the treaty and Doge Urus.
l'll help the rescue team in the crater.

52
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:09,845
Split up. lf you see anything, contact me.

53
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,123
General Windu, we found them!

54
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,713
- We've got what we...
- We're on a very tight timeline here.

55
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,549
How long do you think it'll take
to get the treaty ratified?

56
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:52,429
We are waiting for two more members
of the council to arrive.

57
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,723
They will sign the treaty.

58
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,225
We appreciate your cooperation.

59
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,395
Without your fuel,
our offensive will grind to a halt.

60
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,233
This is the beginning of a great alliance.

61
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,240
What happened down here, trooper?

62
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:17,746
General, there's something down here
with us, and it's not Seppies.

63
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,874
Calm yourself, soldier. We'll check it out.

64
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,711
Trapper, Ponds, Hawkeye, come with me.

65
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:34,596
Skywalker, something strange is going on.
l think you should come down here.

66
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,599
l'm on my way. Artoo, start up my fighter.

67
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,476
lf you'll excuse me...

68
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,734
Sir, there's nothing around here
but rocks and debris.

69
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,278
l have a bad feeling about this.

70
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,322
Skywalker!

71
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,825
- l'm here. What the...
- <i>We need your help!</i>

72
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,838
Artoo, l can't see. Turn on your beacon.

73
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:51,840
Never mind.

74
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,807
What the heck is that thing?

75
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,311
Now's our chance. Let's go!

76
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,659
l've never seen anything like it!

77
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,190
Artoo, get out of here.

78
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,453
What? Uh-oh.

79
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,391
We're going to need some heavy artillery.

80
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:37,153
Don't worry about me, l'm all right.

81
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,408
- Where's your starfighter?
- That thing ate it.

82
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,786
That thing, it is a Zillo Beast.

83
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:49,457
They once roamed Malastare,
devouring our ancestors.

84
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,629
When the Dugs first started
harvesting the fuel in the planet's core,

85
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,756
they were killed off.

86
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,803
They are supposed to be extinct.
Apparently, they're not.

87
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,495
His weakness...

88
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,666
What's going on out there?

89
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,462
lt is an internal matter.
None of your concern.

90
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:41,926
- Your men are killing a unique life form.
- lt is a dangerous, bloodthirsty monster!

91
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:47,599
- Did you forget that it tried to kill you?
- lt was under attack.

92
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,518
lt had lived peacefully below the surface
for all these years.

93
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:54,105
Until you unleashed it with your bomb!

94
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,984
We dropped that bomb
to save your planet, at your request!

95
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,529
To save our fuel for you to buy.

96
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:07,202
lf you want us to sign your treaty,
then you must help us destroy the beast.

97
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:12,332
What purpose would it serve to kill it?
lf it really is the last of its kind...

98
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,375
lt is our duty!

99
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,713
Our ancestors warned us
that one would return someday

100
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,550
and destroy our entire civilization.

101
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,512
Will you help us or not?

102
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:30,183
l respect your traditions
and your ancestors,

103
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:34,646
but we cannot allow the destruction
of an innocent life form.

104
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,316
Then there will be no treaty.

105
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:45,198
Master Windu,
are you certain this argument is worth it?

106
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:49,077
l mean, after all, it's just one creature.
Remember what the Chancellor said.

107
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,205
lt isn't the creature. lt's the principle.

108
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,459
Allowing the Dugs to kill it
violates what we stand for as Jedi.

109
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,045
But if we choose to defend the creature,

110
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,840
we lose all hope
of securing a treaty with the Dugs.

111
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:12,517
We'll handle this our way,
no matter what these Jedi think.

112
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:21,943
<i>How remarkable!
l have never seen anything quite like it.</i>

113
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,989
l recommend that we transport it
off the planet as soon as possible.

114
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:29,325
We can find a place for it to live
undisturbed in the Outer Rim.

115
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,579
<i>And what do the Dugs have to say
on this matter?</i>

116
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,456
They want us to help them destroy it.

117
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:40,420
<i>Then by all means help them.
This creature is of no importance to us.</i>

118
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:44,215
<i>We cannot be alienating the Dugs
at this crucial time.</i>

119
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,635
lt is not the Jedi way
to take an innocent life.

120
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:52,432
- Especially if it is the last of its kind.
- Chancellor Palpatine,

121
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:56,102
l think it would be in our best interest
to study this creature.

122
00:14:56,312 --> 00:15:00,690
lts outer scales are virtually impenetrable.
None of our weapons could harm it.

123
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,984
Even my lightsaber couldn't cut it.

124
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:06,321
lf we could somehow duplicate that
for our ships...

125
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,615
<i>An impenetrable armor.</i>

126
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,160
What if we let the Dugs think we killed it?

127
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,287
Then we could have the treaty
and the creature.

128
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,957
- <i>Yes, Anakin, go on.</i>
- When l was climbing on the creature,

129
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,877
l noticed small gaps
between the armor and its scales.

130
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:24,839
Maybe a stun cannon or a pulse
could penetrate through the skin

131
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:29,135
and short-circuit its nervous system.
Like putting it into a deep sleep.

132
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:32,096
He's right. lt would appear to be dead.

133
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:36,225
We could transport it to a secure location
before it wakes up.

134
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,394
The Dugs would never know
the difference.

135
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,231
<i>That may be the only way
we shall get this treaty signed</i>

136
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,401
<i>and rest Master Windu's conscience.</i>

137
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:04,796
l'm glad you finally decided
to see things our way, Jedi.

138
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:10,885
But you're a fool if you think your weapons
will even scratch Zillo Beast.

139
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:16,057
These are no ordinary weapons.
Your Zillo Beast will be no match for them.

140
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:21,104
Maybe true. But our way is already proven.

141
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,605
Your way?

142
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,400
Open the valve!

143
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,437
Our fuel is deadly to the beast.

144
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:06,816
lt killed them in the past.
lt will kill this one now.

145
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,111
You're only going to provoke it.
You'll drive it out of that hole,

146
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:14,449
- and then it'll be harder to deal with.
- We'll handle it, Jedi.

147
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,140
- Order them to stop!
- What? What do you mean, stop?

148
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:49,025
- l said, order them to stop!
- Or what?

149
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:55,406
We are innocent life forms, too,
are we not?

150
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,305
Charge up the rays!

151
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,039
Fire.

152
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,051
Back up. Back up!

153
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,062
This isn't working!

154
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,596
Whose bright idea was this, anyway?

155
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,645
Keep the beam on him, he's getting tired.

156
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,171
Hey, it worked!

157
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,132
- Are you sure?
- Yes, l'm sure.

158
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,426
You go first.

159
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:30,436
Now we just have to get him out of here.

160
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,661
<i>Welcome to the Republic, Doge Urus.</i>

161
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:51,207
<i>l am sure this business arrangement
will be mutually beneficial.</i>

162
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,003
The beast has been loaded
onto the transport.

163
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,422
Have you selected a planet for relocation?

164
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,676
<i>There has been a slight change of plans.</i>

165
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:07,014
<i>The scientific community has reviewed
the data on this rather unique creature.</i>

166
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:11,435
<i>They believe it should be further studied
in a more controlled environment</i>

167
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,063
<i>before it is released into the wild.</i>

168
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:18,901
- And where is this controlled environment?
- <i>On Coruscant.</i>

169
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:24,949
<i>Master Windu, you and General Skywalker
shall safely bring the beast here.</i>

170
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,082
Well, you made the right choice.

171
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,252
We got our fuel, you saved your creature,
and now he'll be safe.

172
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,881
Let's hope we can say the same
about Coruscant.
