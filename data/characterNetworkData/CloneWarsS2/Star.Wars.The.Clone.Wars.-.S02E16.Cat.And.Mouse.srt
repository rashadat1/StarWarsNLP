1
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,269
<i>An impenetrable defense.</i>

2
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,897
<i>Separatist ships blockade
the resource-rich planet of Christophsis,</i>

3
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:27,234
<i>trapping Senator Bail Organa
and his relief effort.</i>

4
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,403
<i>Desperate to aid the esteemed Senator,</i>

5
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:33,532
<i>a Republic task force under the command
of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker</i>

6
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,492
<i>must break the impasse.</i>

7
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:40,372
But time runs short for the Senator
<i>and the good citizens of Christophsis.</i>

8
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,295
Separatist forces
have overrun our position

9
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,133
<i>and we are out of food,
water and munitions.</i>

10
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,968
<i>Our situation is desperate.</i>

11
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,303
Senator Organa?

12
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,971
Senator Organa!

13
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,390
General, another cruiser's been hit.

14
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,392
Master Kenobi better get here soon

15
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,020
or this is gonna be
one short rescue mission.

16
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,527
The command ship is bearing down on us!

17
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,871
Full forward shields! lncoming fire!

18
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,501
This isn't gonna be easy.

19
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:38,013
Fire all forward cannons,
cut off those Republic supply ships,

20
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,517
separate them from their escort cruisers.

21
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,978
l smell fear

22
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,273
and it smells good.

23
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,283
General, one of the supply ships
has been hit.

24
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,202
Over-fire all reactors.

25
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,455
We're gonna blow right past this guy,
whoever he is.

26
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,585
General, a Republic cruiser is
coming out of hyperspace behind us.

27
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:10,879
Obi-Wan.

28
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,179
Looks like General Skywalker's
already engaged the enemy.

29
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,014
That's nothing out of the ordinary.

30
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,684
Especially since l gave him
a direct order not to.

31
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,984
The Republic ship
is not breaking off its attack.

32
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:36,738
Hold the line. lntensify forward deflectors.

33
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,292
- <i>Anakin, l want you to withdraw.</i>
- Withdraw?

34
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,961
<i>l brought a new toy
that might give us an advantage.</i>

35
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,590
With respect, General,
now might not be a bad time to regroup.

36
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,762
Tell the transports
to fall back to Obi-Wan's position,

37
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,765
we'll cover their retreat
as they escape behind the moon.

38
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,685
l don't like this.
l hope Obi-Wan knows what he's doing.

39
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,582
They are escaping.
Should we go after them?

40
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:33,795
No! Our orders are to blockade, not chase.

41
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,757
l have won this round.

42
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,346
Recycle the shields
and let the cannons reset to a full charge.

43
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,556
Roger, roger.

44
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:49,645
And the enemy will soon return.
And when they do,

45
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,147
we shall be ready.

46
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,679
Well, here l am.
Tell me about this new weapon.

47
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:26,515
- You're looking at it.
- l'm looking at what?

48
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,935
Two steps forward
and you'd actually be kissing it.

49
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,026
lt's a stealth ship.

50
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,660
- Hmm. That's some trick.
- Let's hope the Separatists think so.

51
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,037
So l assume scanners can't detect it?

52
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,791
As far as we know,
but this is the first real field test.

53
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,253
- That's encouraging.
- l figured you'd be up to the challenge.

54
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:01,591
So, l can move in undetected
and take them out from behind.

55
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,762
lt's a pretty small ship
to destroy a whole fleet. Are there more?

56
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:09,558
No, this is the prototype,
and you won't be on the offensive.

57
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,561
l need you to run a mercy mission
down to the planet's surface.

58
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,897
The ship can carry enough supplies
for Senator Organa's headquarters.

59
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,150
Oh, l'm still the delivery boy?

60
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,944
We don't need the whole fleet.
l can do this myself.

61
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,406
Anakin, slow down and do what l tell you.

62
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,451
lt's more important to save lives
than destroy ships.

63
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,411
l need you to continue the mercy mission.

64
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,931
lmpossible, it can't be him.

65
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,309
Tell General Skywalker
to hold his departure.

66
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,727
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

67
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,491
Thank you for waiting, sir.
l'm sorry to hold you up.

68
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,993
No apologies, Admiral. What have you got?

69
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:14,206
Something about this morning's
engagement struck me as familiar,

70
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,376
- so l did a bit of research.
- And?

71
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,463
l believe the opposing commander
is none other than Admiral Trench.

72
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:25,175
lf l remember my military history,

73
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:28,178
wasn't he vaporized
at the Battle of Malastare Narrows?

74
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,888
That's what l thought, too.

75
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:33,475
But the tactics employed,
the efficiency of the droids' maneuvers,

76
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,894
and then there's this.

77
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,398
The last time l saw that symbol,

78
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,359
well, let's just say
l lost a lot of good men that day.

79
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,820
What do l need to know?

80
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,197
l have seen his work firsthand.

81
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:52,160
A corporate fleet was blockading
Malastare, a fleet led by Trench.

82
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,539
That's why l recognized the tactics.

83
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:59,876
He tore our ships apart.
We barely escaped with our lives.

84
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:04,548
ln the end, a Jedi-led task force moved in
to settle the matter.

85
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:09,136
Trench's ship was destroyed
and we assumed he went down with it.

86
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:13,014
- Hmm. Are you sure it's him?
- lt's possible.

87
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,684
Not every captain goes down with his ship.

88
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,895
Well, we may be in luck then, Admiral,

89
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:24,317
my orders are not to engage Trench,
just to deliver supplies to Senator Organa.

90
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,194
With all due respect, General,

91
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,864
l do not believe
we will have a choice in the matter.

92
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,909
lf it is indeed Trench, he will come for us.

93
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,829
- Us?
- Yes.

94
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,458
l'm volunteering my services
as consultant, General.

95
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,792
Welcome aboard.

96
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,588
Hurry up, rookie, we're leaving.

97
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,717
CT 1284, Spark reporting for duty, sir.

98
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,888
We lost one of our starting lineup, kid.
You ready to step up and take his place?

99
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,639
Yes, sir, just show me my station.

100
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,768
You'll be sitting right across from me,

101
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:02,772
where l can keep an eye on you
until you're up to speed.

102
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,275
Everyone's onboard, we are go.

103
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,986
Dispatch, we are powering up
and ready to go.

104
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,878
- Going silent in 10.
- Systems green.

105
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,380
Power core steady, pick up
your scanning five targets...

106
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:30,800
- Engage cloaking device.
- ...and 12-1-5.

107
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,086
Doesn't look like they can detect us.

108
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:10,298
Yes, but if you get any closer they may
not need scanners to know we're here.

109
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,593
Relax, Admiral.
Hey, you wanted to come on this ride.

110
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:22,143
l cannot calculate why the Republic fleet
has not launched another attack?

111
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:27,524
What is the status
of the assault on Christophsis?

112
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,651
Resistance is crumbling, sir,

113
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,612
l would estimate a half rotation
before it is over.

114
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,199
We need to add some pressure

115
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:41,997
on those who were sent to rescue
our enemies on Christophsis.

116
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,750
Hmm.

117
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:51,840
Send the Hyena bombers
to hit Senator Organa on the surface.

118
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:57,721
That should draw those cowards out
from behind the moon.

119
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,035
General, we have incoming bombers
with fighter escort.

120
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:30,003
Enemy ships closing,
15,000, 14,000, 13,000...

121
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,213
What's our defensive capability?

122
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,591
We've got torpedoes
and anti-aircraft cannons, sir,

123
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,551
but we'd have to de-cloak to use either.

124
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,303
Yeah, and if they don't know we're here

125
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,430
that would give our position away
pretty quickly.

126
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,062
...9,000, 8,000...

127
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,731
- Have they detected us?
- Can't tell, sir.

128
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,817
lf we are going on the offensive
we must do it soon!

129
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,904
...5,000, 4,000...

130
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,408
Stay cloaked, power everything else down,
let her drift.

131
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,579
...2,000,

132
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,249
1,000...

133
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,960
- They're going to hit us!
- Five hundred!

134
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,975
They missed us.
They don't know we're here.

135
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,186
They're heading for Bail Organa
and the command center.

136
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,354
They're going to bomb it!

137
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,692
Sir, we have incoming bombers!

138
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,157
Get me General Kenobi!

139
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,202
<i>We are under attack
by the Separatist fleet.</i>

140
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,621
<i>They're coming by air and by ground.</i>

141
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,958
<i>We can't hold out any longer.
There's little chance for survival.</i>

142
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,669
<i>Help us, General Kenobi,
you're our only hope.</i>

143
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,422
Get me Anakin.

144
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,925
Anakin, l've just spoken to the Senator,

145
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,969
<i>they're in dire need of our help.</i>

146
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,263
<i>Continue with your mission
to the planet's surface.</i>

147
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,391
<i>l will engage Trench's fleet
with the ships l already have.</i>

148
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,101
General Kenobi, with all due respect,

149
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:11,229
you do not have the resources
to engage Trench openly.

150
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,982
He wants you to attack,
you'll be walking into a trap.

151
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,360
He's right, Master,
you won't stand a chance.

152
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,989
<i>Anakin, l've got enough problems
without you becoming one of them.</i>

153
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,242
<i>Get those supplies to the refugee camp.
l'll worry about Trench.</i>

154
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,996
- <i>Just stay on course and...</i>
- Your tactic won't work.

155
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,000
Prep torpedo tubes one through four.
Fix range on Trench's command ship.

156
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,502
- Sir?
- You heard me, Admiral.

157
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,298
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
- We need to destroy Trench,

158
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,633
and this ship
has the best chance of doing that.

159
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:45,555
- <i>l want those supplies on the surface now.</i>
- Don't worry, l'm on it.

160
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,474
<i>Anakin!</i>

161
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,895
The Republic fleet is holding position.

162
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,856
This is unusual.

163
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,943
What can they be planning?

164
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,038
Prepare to de-cloak on my command.

165
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,541
<i>Prep torpedo tubes one through four.
Fix range on Trench's command ship.</i>

166
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,668
l thought we were on a relief mission.

167
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,463
You'll learn pretty quick that
when you serve under General Skywalker

168
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:22,008
you're always on the offensive.
Now get ready to cycle those shields.

169
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,594
You realize
our torpedoes may not be enough.

170
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:28,765
All l want is for Trench to think about us
instead of the people on the planet below.

171
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,726
lt's time to introduce ourselves.

172
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,064
Activate the turbo chargers.
Release torpedo safety!

173
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:41,069
- Ready to divert power!
- Shield regeneration on standby.

174
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,990
Hmm.

175
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:50,829
Something odd is going on out there.

176
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,251
Ready torpedoes,
lock onto primary target.

177
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,922
Disengage cloaking device.

178
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,265
There! A cloaked ship!

179
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,766
Fire!

180
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,022
- Torpedoes locked and closing.
- Activate the shields.

181
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,991
Foolish Republic scum.

182
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:33,121
Your puny torpedoes
are no match for my thermo-shields.

183
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,915
Prepare to fire all cannons!

184
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,460
Well, that did little good.

185
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,506
- Re-cloaking in nine, eight...
- Fire!

186
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,259
...six, five...

187
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,471
- Pilot, prep the flares.
- Too late, General!

188
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,974
Launch flares!

189
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,186
And cloak!

190
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,864
Fire a spread of lasers.

191
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,661
- lncoming!
- l see it.

192
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,476
Scans are coming up negative. We missed.

193
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,852
Yes,

194
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,564
but we have learned something.

195
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:47,195
No clone could successfully fly
through that many lasers.

196
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:51,324
We are dealing with a Jedi.

197
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,704
Patch me into the com channel,
open frequency.

198
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,005
What you got, Spark?

199
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,092
There's an open communication signal
coming from the enemy.

200
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,635
Better tell the General.

201
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,097
Now that they know we are here,
what's your plan?

202
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,058
l'll think of something, Admiral.
ln the meantime,

203
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,395
l've got Trench right where l want him,
thinking about us.

204
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,107
General, there's a transmission
on the open frequency, it's the enemy.

205
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,733
Put it through.

206
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,779
Hello, ugly.

207
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:33,741
<i>l am Admiral Trench.</i>

208
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:38,913
<i>lf you are listening, Jedi,
you've made a bold move</i>

209
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,082
<i>and a grave mistake.</i>

210
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:48,214
<i>l appreciate your decision to face me,
ship to ship, to play this little game.</i>

211
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:53,261
lt's been so long
since l had a worthy opponent.

212
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:56,597
You have an impressive new vessel,

213
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:02,186
<i>but l warn you,
l have dealt with its kind before.</i>

214
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,815
<i>Your technology will not save you.</i>

215
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:12,280
<i>And your friends on the planet below
shall perish as a result of your failure.</i>

216
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,035
<i>The people of Christophsis
and her resources</i>

217
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,998
<i>shall join the Separatist Alliance.</i>

218
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,835
<i>Turn back now, retreat while you can,</i>

219
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:30,131
<i>for l am your doom.</i>

220
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,803
He said he's dealt
with this kind of ship before.

221
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,764
How?

222
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:42,185
l calculate the Jedi will not turn back
as you request, Admiral.

223
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,398
Of course not. l do not expect him to.

224
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:54,280
He'll attack again. A stealth ship
could have passed our blockade easily,

225
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:57,450
this Jedi chose to attack.

226
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,368
<i>You were right, Admiral,</i>

227
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:03,581
<i>there are records of Trench's battles and
a few against ships with cloaking devices.</i>

228
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,541
- And?
- <i>lt seems, in each case,</i>

229
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,044
<i>he used tracking torpedoes
to hit the ship somehow</i>

230
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,879
<i>whether it was cloaked or not.</i>

231
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,048
Then he knows a way of detecting us.

232
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,509
Tracking torpedoes? Hmm.

233
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,135
What class ship was he fighting?

234
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,263
<i>Mostly cruiser to cruiser,
nothing as small as your ship.</i>

235
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,725
Well, no ship this small
usually has a cloaking device.

236
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,270
Maybe he's tracking
the magnetic signature...

237
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:30,108
Thanks, Obi-Wan. Hold off your attack
until we destroy Trench.

238
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,152
<i>Might l remind you
that this was not your mission?</i>

239
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,320
You might.

240
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,532
Admiral, prepare to disengage
cloaking device and fire.

241
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,493
Battle stations!

242
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,162
- Engineering, check.
- Navigation, check.

243
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,873
- Guns, check.
- Torpedoes, check.

244
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,502
- Shields, check.
- Admiral, we are ready and waiting.

245
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,379
Your move, General.

246
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,505
Fire!

247
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,180
There she is!

248
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,058
Re-cloaking in five, four...

249
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:08,104
Sir, four more Republic torpedoes
armed and closing.

250
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,901
Lock us onto that ship's
magnetic signature.

251
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,450
Magnetic signature locked.

252
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:25,788
Arm tracking torpedoes
and fire on my command.

253
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:30,501
But, sir, we cannot fire
unless we lower our shields.

254
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,171
Lower shields and fire!

255
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,964
Lowering shields.

256
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,805
General, l really hope
you know what you're doing.

257
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,140
So do l, Admiral.

258
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,066
They are turning around.

259
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,444
General, the cloaking device is active,

260
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,070
but they're locked onto
our magnetic signature.

261
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,823
He took the bait.
Turn off the cloaking device,

262
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,825
divert all power to the engines.

263
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:14,503
- He is headed right for us.
- He can't! Raise the shields!

264
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,423
We cannot, the shields are still recharging.

265
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,072
- That's the way! Yes!
- We did it!

266
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,865
- We made it!
- Good job!

267
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,577
<i>l hate to admit it, but good job, Anakin.</i>

268
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,247
We're beginning our attack
on the Separatist fleet.

269
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:53,501
Have fun. l'll be delivering the supplies
to the surface, Master.

270
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,558
General Skywalker,
l have no idea how you did it,

271
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,686
but you saved a great many lives today.

272
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,022
Good job, kid. Looks like you're now

273
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,525
- officially part of the crew.
- Thanks, Commander.

274
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,988
Well, looks like we make
a pretty good team.

275
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:27,076
l must admit, l am a bit surprised
at the reckless nature of your tactics,

276
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,704
though l cannot argue with their results.

277
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:34,208
Well, you'll find
l like to do things, uh,

278
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,502
differently from time to time.

279
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,547
lndeed, the Chancellor mentioned as much,

280
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,551
though he insisted
it was the highest compliment.
