1
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,477
<i>Jedi trapped on Felucia!</i>

2
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:23,105
<i>Clones are surrounded by droid forces.</i>

3
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,899
<i>Their only hope is to escape
on Republic gunships</i>

4
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:28,444
<i>waiting to land on the embattled surface.</i>

5
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:31,613
<i>Jedi cruisers have managed
to blow a hole in the droid defenses</i>

6
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,949
<i>and have sent gunships to the rescue.</i>

7
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:39,121
Warthog, protect the gunships.
l will take out the fighters.

8
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,137
They made it through the first wave.

9
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,097
Concentrate all fire
on the cruiser on the left.

10
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,544
l can't shake these two droids!

11
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,838
Come around
and l'll try to get them off your tail.

12
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,593
General!

13
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,519
Look out!

14
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,358
That was close.

15
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,653
lf those fighters got through,
then our gunships can't be far behind.

16
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,323
Prepare the troops to evacuate.

17
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,873
- Go! Go!
- Come on!

18
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,669
Come on, grunts! We are leaving!

19
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,511
Ahsoka should be back
from herjungle patrol by now.

20
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,722
l'll try to contact her again.
Ahsoka, where are you?

21
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,063
- <i>Ahsoka, what is your location?</i>
- About 6 clicks east, Master.

22
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,566
We've engaged the enemy
and we've got them on the run.

23
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,072
<i>They're here to extract us.
We're leaving!</i>

24
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,574
What? What...

25
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,535
We can't retreat now, Master.
l've broken through.

26
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,246
Move it, trooper!
Come on, double-time!

27
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,874
<i>The droids are retreating.</i>

28
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,502
We're outnumbered. You must evacuate.
That is an order!

29
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,172
<i>Master Skywalker taught me
never to let up</i>

30
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,673
<i>when the tinnies are on the run.</i>

31
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,384
They are running back here
to regroup with the main force!

32
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,935
You are putting your troops' lives
in danger, young one.

33
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,271
You will get on the gunship
when we arrive.

34
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:12,065
- Where's Ahsoka?
- Following your teachings.

35
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,276
- ls she winning?
- For now.

36
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,246
- She's not stopping.
- Land in front of them.

37
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,959
What are you doing?

38
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,467
- Get in the ship, now!
- Can't you see they're retreating?

39
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,470
They're about to overrun you, Ahsoka.
You just can't see it.

40
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,931
Now, follow orders and get in the ship.

41
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,033
Padawan Ahsoka,

42
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,662
do you feel Master Kenobi's
description of the incident is accurate?

43
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,498
Yes, my Masters.

44
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,460
- More to add, do you?
- l know l was wrong.

45
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:18,048
l just got so caught up in my own success
l didn't look at the battle as a whole.

46
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:22,010
l wasn't being disobedient, l just forgot.

47
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:25,180
Masters, this incident is my responsibility.

48
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:29,309
Because ofAhsoka's advanced abilities,
l forgot how young she is.

49
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,353
l gave her more freedom
than l should have.

50
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:35,315
That may be, but it doesn't excuse
what happened on Felucia.

51
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,986
l think she needs some time
away from the battlefield.

52
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:46,034
On Archive security,
reflect on your actions you can, Padawan.

53
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:50,539
- Guard duty? For how long?
- Longer, now.

54
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:01,550
- l'm sorry l let you down.
- l know.

55
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,177
l was a Padawan not that long ago.

56
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:10,517
Madame Jocasta Nu, this is Ahsoka Tano.
She is to be your new security officer.

57
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,937
- Hello, Madame.
- So good to meet you.

58
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,441
Let's show you around.

59
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:23,030
There is more knowledge here
than anywhere else in the galaxy.

60
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,158
Master Kenobi says
there are even texts here

61
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,743
that are forbidden to be read.

62
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:33,457
Well, the Archives hold
a great many secrets, 'tis true.

63
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:38,045
Beyond this door lies the holocron vault.

64
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:43,258
The holocrons contain the most
closely guarded secrets of the Jedi Order.

65
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,219
Good morning, Master Fisto.

66
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,934
- Can we go inside?
- Oh, l'm afraid not, my dear.

67
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,438
l haven't been inside myself for years.

68
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:00,567
Only members of the Jedi Council
are allowed access.

69
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,779
Guarding the holocrons
is one of the most important duties

70
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,907
a Jedi can be given, Ahsoka.

71
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,285
- Do you think you're up to the task?
- Definitely.

72
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,469
<i>Excuse the interruption.</i>

73
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:32,265
<i>As l was saying, bounty hunter,
l have need of your services.</i>

74
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,226
l'm listening.

75
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,771
<i>l need a Jedi holocron.</i>

76
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,942
To get a holocron,
l'd have to break into the Jedi Temple.

77
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:45,278
lt's impossible, not to mention deadly.

78
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:49,783
<i>Perhaps your reputation
has been exaggerated.</i>

79
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,952
l want a Rogue-class starfighter

80
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:55,080
with elite weapons,
cloaking device, the works.

81
00:06:55,164 --> 00:07:01,044
- Oh, and triple my usual rate.
- <i>Your price is of no concern.</i>

82
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,883
<i>l will also provide you
with the means to get inside the Temple.</i>

83
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,302
You've got a deal.

84
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:14,599
The setback at Felucia has affected
our efforts in the whole sector.

85
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,476
lt'll take weeks before we...

86
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:21,356
- Master Yoda, what is it?
- A disturbance in the Force.

87
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,860
lntruders there will be in this Temple.

88
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,618
You know, if you would just tell me
what it is you're doing back there,

89
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,537
l could probably be of some assistance.

90
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:39,040
Look, l'm just doing
some maintenance.

91
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,251
You've been having memory crashes.

92
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:44,963
That is preposterous.
l have no memory of any crashes.

93
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,383
Oh, my goodness!
l have no memory of any crashes!

94
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,718
Exactly.

95
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,264
Oh, no. l am doomed!
Bane, you have to help me!

96
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,185
- Calm down, l'm done.
- Oh. Thank you.

97
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,811
Get the door.

98
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,231
l am a techno-service droid,
not a butler droid.

99
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,234
Can it, Todo. You are what l say you are.

100
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,652
Well! Then...

101
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,618
Who are you?

102
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:19,080
l am Todo 360, techno-service droid.
Who are you?

103
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:22,918
- None of your business.
- Everyone is in a good mood today.

104
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:32,135
- Who's that?
- Bolla Ropal. Jedi, out in the Mid Rim.

105
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,429
- We going after him?
- Soon.

106
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,973
Right now we're stealing a holocron.

107
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,603
lmpossible. The only place
you can get a holocron is...

108
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:45,649
l know, inside the main vaults
of the Jedi Temple.

109
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:50,278
Fortunately, our Sith Lord client
has set us up with some help.

110
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,949
For one, the map of the Temple
you're looking at right now.

111
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,786
For another, a security chip
that l've placed in my droid.

112
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,163
l have been given all the technical data

113
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,916
regarding security systems
in the Jedi Temple.

114
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,335
Both the vent shafts and the vault itself

115
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:09,130
are equipped with all kinds of traps
and security measures.

116
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,840
Todo can take them out,

117
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:15,136
but we'll need help
from someone inside the Jedi library.

118
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:19,182
And that's where your talents
as a changeling will come in.

119
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:25,355
- He looks like a Jedi.
- He was. His name was Ord Enisence.

120
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,608
You should be able
to walk into the Archives

121
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,194
and monitor us without a problem.

122
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,211
Now that l am a Jedi,

123
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,630
l can do that.

124
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,633
Good. You'll need these.

125
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,012
They're ear comlinks
so we can keep in communication.

126
00:09:57,054 --> 00:10:00,181
Hmm. The vault is in the library,

127
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,726
which backs onto
the communications center.

128
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:07,355
- There'll be swarms of Jedi nearby.
- We'll use that to our advantage.

129
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:12,027
Even if you get into the vault,
how are you going to crack that safe?

130
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:16,239
Let me worry about the safe.
First things first.

131
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,872
Where do we start looking
for these intruders?

132
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,206
What could they be after?

133
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,500
l doubt they've come to hijack starfighters.

134
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,587
What can they get here
that they can't get anywhere else?

135
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,381
- lnformation.
- The Jedi transmitter codes.

136
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,051
Every piece of troop information
in one place.

137
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,679
- And it's all in the east tower.
- The east tower communications center.

138
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,764
l'll head there right away.

139
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,351
l'll monitor the perimeter defenses
from the central security station.

140
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:11,628
- Good afternoon, Master Enisence.
- Good afternoon, young one.

141
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,713
May l be of assistance?

142
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,885
No. No, thank you, my dear.
l don't want to bother you.

143
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,222
Oh, it wouldn't be a bother at all, Master.

144
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:25,266
Things are slow right now.
l could use something to do.

145
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,936
Oh, uh...

146
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,438
<i>Cato, come in.
Cato, are you there yet?</i>

147
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,648
Cato, come in!

148
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,902
Thank you. l'll be fine on my own.

149
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,321
You sure?

150
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:43,076
Look, youngling, l said l was fine.
Now let me go about my business.

151
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,496
Can't do anything right these days.

152
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,257
- l'm in.
- lt's about time.

153
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,342
<i>Just tell us where to get in.</i>

154
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:03,513
All right, there's a weak point in the shield
that Todo should be able to break through.

155
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,265
l'm beaming him the coordinates now.

156
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,809
Okay, l have got it.

157
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,770
l will jam the Temple's scanners.

158
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,857
Let's see, it is around here somewhere.

159
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,363
There!

160
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,658
- ln.
- You're welcome.

161
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:30,206
- What was that?
- The system is just recycling, sir.

162
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,919
<i>Master, l'm in the tower. No intruders,
but something just happened.</i>

163
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,505
<i>All the scanners were behaving strangely
for a moment.</i>

164
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,008
Yes, something happened
to the system down here, too.

165
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,010
lt cannot be a coincidence.

166
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,722
Arrived, the intruders have.

167
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,266
But if they are not in the tower,
what are they after?

168
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,186
The communications center, perhaps,
their target is.

169
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,022
<i>They must be
in the central ventilation system.</i>

170
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,857
Let me check the system.

171
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,236
You're right, there has been a disturbance.
lt's near the top of the south tower.

172
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:05,033
- <i>l'll meet you up there.</i>
- On high alert, place the Temple.

173
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,876
The control board for the fan
should be on your left.

174
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,382
All clear, sir.

175
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,642
Not quite. The fan you're passing through
has a security switch.

176
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:34,604
l do not see anything.
Besides, we've already gotten past the fan.

177
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:36,898
Oh!

178
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,192
Todo! We're getting sucked into the fan!

179
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,862
- Turn it off!
- l do not know how!

180
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,365
- Cato, do something!
- l've got it from here.

181
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,662
Sorry.

182
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,057
Okay, Bane,
the next part is relatively simple.

183
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,101
Make your way down the shaft,
until you reach...

184
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:20,191
Excuse me. l don't mean to disturb you,
but the whole Temple is on high alert.

185
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,735
Thank you.

186
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,924
- This is it.
- Perfect. Let's go in.

187
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:48,303
No. Cato, come in. We're over the vault.

188
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,264
<i>Give me a
moment to check out the security system.</i>

189
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:55,894
- What's wrong with your voice?
- Change of plans. l'm the librarian now.

190
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,897
Hurry it up, Cato.
We can't stay hidden for long.

191
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,942
Well, looks like
this is where they broke in.

192
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,486
Fortunately we'll have
a less troublesome time.

193
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,748
The vault is filled with laser sensors
that go in every direction.

194
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,459
<i>l'll try to deactivate the whole system
from here.</i>

195
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:23,671
Just hurry. l can hear them.
They're looking for us in the vent system.

196
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:38,186
- Great. Which way do you think they went?
- The communications center is this way.

197
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:41,064
We'd better hurry
if we're going to catch them.

198
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:47,695
- The Jedi are coming closer.
- <i>l've got it. Go in.</i>

199
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,210
l don't think they came this way.

200
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:06,172
Master Yoda, are you picking up
any other life signs in this quadrant?

201
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,591
Deep in the Temple, the intruders are.

202
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,843
How are they managing
to stay out of our way?

203
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:17,183
Possible it is,
receiving assistance they are from inside.

204
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,352
Wonderful.

205
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:23,982
Almost there. Are you done
deactivating those laser beams yet?

206
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,987
- We are good to go.
- Good. Start cutting through that wall.

207
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,699
This job just keeps getting
weirder and weirder.

208
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:42,750
<i>Padawan, alert, you must be.
Sense deception, l do.</i>

209
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,420
<i>Posing as a Jedi the intruder is.</i>

210
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,089
<i>Find Master Jocasta you must.</i>

211
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,014
Bane,
the two Jedi have turned around

212
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,765
and are making their way towards you.

213
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,396
Who are you and what have you done
with Madame Jocasta?

214
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,524
The same thing l'm going to do to you.

215
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:45,313
You may have Madame Jocasta's shape,
but not her skills.

216
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,819
- Todo, are you done yet?
- These things take time.

217
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:56,824
- Some butler droid you turned out to be.
- l am a techno-service droid!

218
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,998
Looks like you were right.

219
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:08,377
<i>Master Skywalker, l've captured
the impostor disguised as a Jedi.</i>

220
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,963
<i>She says the intruder
is in the holocron vault.</i>

221
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,050
A holocron is no good
without a Jedi to open it.

222
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,343
What are they up to?

223
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,679
They must be trying to gain access to
the communications center from the vault.

224
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,847
Let's get in there.

225
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:25,520
l'm not going to be able to do this
without a diagram. Cato, come in!

226
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,730
- Cato?
- What has happened?

227
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,691
Something's gone wrong.
Todo, is the hole finished?

228
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,194
- Yes. But...
- Go to the communications center.

229
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,363
- What?
- You heard me.

230
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,366
Bane, the communications center
will be crawling with Jedi.

231
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,742
Why do l need to go in there?

232
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,911
- Now!
- Okay! Okay!

233
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,899
Quick! The communications center!
Let's go!

234
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,895
Oh! Uh...

235
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,438
Hey, guys!

236
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:59,697
l was just, um, testing the access hatch.
Works great.

237
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,451
- Bomb!
- Bomb? What bomb?

238
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,952
ls there something going to blow up?

239
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:07,914
Bomb!

240
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,125
No! No, no, no, no, no...

241
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,810
Madame Librarian, are you okay?

242
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:34,732
l think l'm all right. We must call security.

243
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:46,994
Hmm. Our war operations
it was never about.

244
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:51,958
Come on, changeling,
we have a new home for you.

245
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,294
What would someone want
with a holocron?

246
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,630
Wait.

247
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,841
Bolla Ropal.

248
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,470
- What did you say?
- Bolla Ropal.

249
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:08,391
That's who Bane's next target is,
some Jedi.

250
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:14,981
- What's wrong? Who's Bolla Ropal?
- He is the keeper of the Kyber crystal,

251
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,900
the data on which
can only be read by holocrons.

252
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,360
What's on the crystal?

253
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:23,364
A list of every known Force-sensitive child
in the galaxy.

254
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:27,201
The future younglings.
The future of the Jedi Order.

255
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,538
- We have to warn him.
- That's going to be hard to do.

256
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,083
He's out of contact,
somewhere in the Devaron system.

257
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:38,629
- Seek him out, you must.
- Ahsoka and l will set out immediately.

258
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,925
lf this Cad Bane is still here on Coruscant,
l'll find him.
