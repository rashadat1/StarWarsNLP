1
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:22,312
<i>Fugitive! Though the Republic
has won many decisive battles</i>

2
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,648
<i>against the Separatist army
in the Outer Rim,</i>

3
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:28,736
<i>the Jedi have failed
to capture the elusive General Grievous.</i>

4
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,574
<i>After specifically targeting members
of the Jedi Council, a trap was set,</i>

5
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,909
<i>but following a fierce confrontation,</i>

6
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:40,539
<i>the droid general managed to escape
to the surface of the planet Saleucami.</i>

7
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,332
<i>Now the chase is on</i>

8
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,502
<i>as General Kenobi leads a squadron
of clone troopers</i>

9
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,422
<i>and closes in on his desperate target.</i>

10
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:57,973
We must find a way off this planet
before they find us.

11
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:03,520
Kenobi! We need to hurry
and find an escape pod.

12
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,487
lnstead of scattering our troops
looking for all the escape pods,

13
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,281
we shall head towards the wreckage
of the landing transport first.

14
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,496
Contact the fleet.

15
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,832
Sir, our transmitter is destroyed.

16
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:28,170
There is only one escape pod
that survived.

17
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:34,343
We must get there as quickly as possible.
Let's hope the transmitter is still intact.

18
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,179
Now, find me some transportation.

19
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:57,407
General Kenobi!
Sir, the cruiser's returned to orbit.

20
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:01,787
- Any sign of Grievous?
- l believe we've found Grievous' ship.

21
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,666
Power low.

22
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:09,294
The power is...
l can't go on.

23
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,548
Sir, we need to get our power recharged.

24
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:18,178
Not this again. How could your power cells
be so depleted?

25
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,682
You would not let us ride
on one of those creatures with you, sir.

26
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:24,059
lf you would allow us to close down
for a few...

27
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,896
Any more complaints?

28
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,399
- No. Nope. No.
- No. l don't think so.

29
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,526
That's what l thought.

30
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,237
Now, let's find that pod.

31
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,531
Yikes.

32
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,958
Thermal housing intakes are still warm.
This couldn't have happened too long ago.

33
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,377
The crew compartment's
almost entirely destroyed.

34
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,254
We'll split into teams.

35
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,299
Rex, take Jesse, Hardcase and Kix
and search those wetlands.

36
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,425
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,261
Cody, you, Crys and l will pick it up
from here.

38
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:04,308
And, Rex, if you get a visual on Grievous,
contact us before you engage.

39
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:13,859
- Rex is a smart man.
- lndeed. Always thinking on his feet.

40
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,450
These droids are too gone
to give us any good intel.

41
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,039
Here's one!

42
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:33,629
Let's load the droid in the tank.
We'll inspect it on the go.

43
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,813
ln range.

44
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,358
Take the shot.

45
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,737
Protect the Captain!

46
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,334
Commando droids.

47
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,549
Jesse, you better get back here.

48
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,391
What do you have?

49
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,560
We've broken the access codes and
powered up the droid's guidance system.

50
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,020
According to his memory logs,

51
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,022
he fired the emergency thrusters
on the escape pod

52
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,732
to avoid a midair collision.

53
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,985
- Collision with what?
- Another escape pod.

54
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,320
There was no time to correct
for the steeper glide path,

55
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,572
which is why this droid's pod crashed.

56
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,158
Can you pinpoint the landing zone
for the other pod?

57
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,494
l can put us
within two to three clicks of it, sir.

58
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,289
Alert the men. We've picked up the scent.

59
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,375
- How bad?
- Pretty bad.

60
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,211
l need to remove his armor
to see the full extent of the damage.

61
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,422
Those snipers might have called
for backup.

62
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,716
Unless we want
to start getting picked off one by one,

63
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,926
- we should find better cover first.
- Mmm-hmm.

64
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,931
Wait a minute.
Those critters are domesticated.

65
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:11,268
- Sir?
- l think we're on farmland.

66
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:15,105
And where there's a farm,
there's usually a farmer.

67
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,565
Let's find his homestead.

68
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,418
We want no trouble here.

69
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,505
Easy with that weapon, ma'am.
We're here as friends.

70
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,258
- State your business.
- Our captain's been hurt. We need...

71
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,844
- l'm no doctor, so just...
- We have a medic, ma'am.

72
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,305
We just need a place
to tend to him overnight.

73
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,183
- Mommy, who's...
- Get back inside, both of you!

74
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,559
Oh!
Mom!

75
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,437
Look, there are some benches
out back in the barn.

76
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,565
- lt's the best l can do.
- That'll be fine, ma'am. Thank you.

77
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,032
What... What happened?

78
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,825
Commando droids took a potshot.

79
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:12,662
That would've gone straight through your
heart had it been two inches to the left.

80
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,791
- l can't move my arm.
- You have some nerve damage.

81
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:20,212
Understood. Now patch me up,
and let's get on with it.

82
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:24,466
Sir, you're in no condition.
lt will heal, but it will take time.

83
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,676
We're getting
underway, Kix.

84
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:30,013
- That's an order.
- Sir, as the team medic,

85
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,141
when it comes to the health of the men,
including you,

86
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,518
l outrank everyone.

87
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,646
So l respectfully order you, sir,

88
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,773
- to get some...
- Excuse me.

89
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,361
- lf there's not enough...
- That's plenty. Thank you, uh...

90
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,654
Suu.

91
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,534
l told you to stay in the house.

92
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,495
l couldn't help it, Mom. lt got away.

93
00:06:56,874 --> 00:07:02,421
- You look like my daddy.
- Shaeeah, don't bother the soldier.

94
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,507
- Now get inside with your brother.
- Yes, Mom.

95
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,011
My husband is away
delivering our first harvest.

96
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,764
- Do you require anything else?
- No.

97
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,808
- Thank you, Suu.
- Mmm.

98
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:25,527
Resume the search without me.
Jesse, you're in command. l'll be fine.

99
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,791
There's our escape pod.

100
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,546
- Any sign of Grievous?
- lt looks deserted.

101
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,049
He must be heading
to a second escape pod.

102
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,553
- Captain Rex, come in, please.
- lt's Jesse, sir.

103
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,306
- <i>Rex was injured.</i>
- What's his condition?

104
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,225
He'll be fine. But we had
to find him shelter for the night.

105
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,479
Grievous is on the move.
We're headed to the west.

106
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,023
Swing around and we can meet up
at the final escape pod.

107
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,067
<i>We're going to need all the firepower
we can muster.</i>

108
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,819
Roger that, sir.
We're speeding towards you.

109
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,171
No, no, no, no, no.

110
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,034
We should be there by now.

111
00:08:56,118 --> 00:09:01,122
We are, sir,
there almost.

112
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:05,293
You had better be interpreting
the coordinates correctly.

113
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,171
Oh, no.

114
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,968
We're almost there, sir. One click out.
Straight ahead.

115
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:17,472
l'm losing power.

116
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,343
Who are you? What are you doing here?

117
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,639
You're a clone.

118
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:04,352
So, l see the war has finally made its way
out here.

119
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:08,481
And l guess l can expect a visit
from some droids soon.

120
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,108
What's your number and rank?

121
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:16,990
My name is Lawquane. Cut
Lawquane. And l'm just a simple farmer.

122
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,658
You're a deserter.

123
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,577
Well,

124
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:24,414
l like to think l'm merely
exercising my freedom to choose.

125
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,044
- To choose not to kill for a living.
- That is not your choice to make.

126
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,505
You swore an oath to the Republic.
You have a duty.

127
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:37,302
l have a duty. You're right.
But it's to my family.

128
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,138
Does that count,
or do you still plan to turn me in?

129
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,556
Do l have a choice?

130
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,725
Daddy, you're home!

131
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,436
Look what l drew you, Dad!

132
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,482
Well, well, well.
That's great, Jek.

133
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,192
l see you two have met.

134
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,070
He looks just like you, Daddy. l told him.

135
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,114
Oh, you did, huh?

136
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,034
l was just making our guest, Captain, um...

137
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,327
What's your number?

138
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,413
Rex. l also have a name, believe it or not.

139
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:10,919
He was injured. His men brought him here.
l told them he could stay just for the night.

140
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,923
Course he can.
We never turn away those in need, do we?

141
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,176
No, we always help anyone we can.

142
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,763
Right. You, um... You look hungry, Rex.

143
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:26,768
- No, l'm fine. l'll stay here.
- No, you have to eat with us, please!

144
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,269
- Please! Please!
- Please!

145
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,105
They're never gonna stop till you say yes.

146
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,731
All right, l'll join you.

147
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:49,290
Yes, well, you and l may be clones,
but we're still individuals.

148
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,752
You have a name rather than a number,
Captain. Why is that?

149
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:56,631
Perhaps our leaders feel it's
a more efficient way of distinguishing us.

150
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,925
More efficient than a number?

151
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,636
l doubt the Kaminoans think that way.

152
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,931
Still, a name has to make you feel unique.

153
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,934
Especially in an army where everyone
looks like you and talks like you...

154
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,603
Actually, l've never really thought about it.

155
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,231
- Yes, you have.
- Well, how would you know?

156
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:17,777
Because l am as close to you
as any life form can be.

157
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:23,074
l've seen how you look
at my family, our home...

158
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,163
Come on, Rex, admit it. You've thought
about what your life could look like

159
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:32,083
if you were to also leave the army,
choose the life you want.

160
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,836
What if l am choosing the life l want?

161
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,173
What if l'm staying in the army
because it's meaningful to me?

162
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,592
And how is it meaningful?

163
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:44,637
Because l'm part of the most pivotal
moment in the history of the Republic.

164
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,891
lf we fail,
then our children and their children

165
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:51,561
could be forced to live
under an evil l can't well imagine.

166
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,855
lf you were to have children, of course.

167
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:57,358
But that would be against the rules,
wouldn't it?

168
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,944
lsn't that what somebody
programmed you to believe, Captain?

169
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,530
No, Cut, it's simply what l believe.

170
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,825
lt doesn't matter if it's my children
or other people's children.

171
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,869
Does that meet with your approval?

172
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:11,206
Perfectly. To each his own.
That's what l always say.

173
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,874
What does that mean, Daddy?

174
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,044
lt means you can do anything
with your life that you want to.

175
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:25,011
- How are you doing, Jesse?
- Closing in, sir. We have a visual.

176
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,597
Very well, we'll meet you in the middle.

177
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:37,690
- ls your transmitter working?
- l don't know. l haven't used it yet.

178
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,401
All right, l'll check on it.

179
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,570
Stupid battle droids!

180
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,572
Sir, you made it.

181
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,782
Get back in the pod

182
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,452
and send out a distress signal
to what's left of our fleet.

183
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,872
We need to get a shuttle
down here immediately.

184
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,583
Roger, roger, but l must inform you, sir,

185
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:59,712
there are multiple life forms approaching
from the east and west.

186
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,130
Battle positions!

187
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,428
Good move. Very good move.

188
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:12,100
- So what was it?
- What made me decide to leave the corps?

189
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,437
Shortly after the Battle of Geonosis,

190
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,941
our troop transport got caught
between two Separatist gunships.

191
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,111
They fired on us with everything they had.
We crashed.

192
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,072
Most of us were either dead
or severely injured.

193
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,951
So when they started working their way
through the wounded, killing us off,

194
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,745
l knew there was no hope. l ran.

195
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,165
lt still haunts me.

196
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,126
l'm sorry.

197
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,963
lt's the day l felt
my life didn't have any meaning.

198
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,425
Everyone l cared about,
my team, was gone.

199
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,138
l was just another expendable clone
waiting for my turn

200
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,807
to be slaughtered in a war
that made no sense to me.

201
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,351
Can you understand that, Rex?

202
00:14:56,812 --> 00:15:00,356
l've been in countless battles
and lost many brothers.

203
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:03,109
They were my family, my home.

204
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:12,160
Daddy, we finished our chores.
Can we go outside and play?

205
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,328
Please.

206
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,665
- Okay, only for a few minutes.
- Thank you, Daddy! Come on, Jek.

207
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,375
- Okay.
- And keep the house in view.

208
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,543
We will.

209
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,629
You have wonderful children.

210
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,174
l know you think l'm a coward, Rex.

211
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,720
But believe me, l'll fight to my last breath
to keep them safe.

212
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,808
Fire!

213
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,653
Tank two! Port side!

214
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,657
Great shot!

215
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,659
Where is that ship?

216
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,873
Shaeeah? Where are you?

217
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,588
Shaeeah, where are you?
Stop fooling around.

218
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:06,965
Boo!

219
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,343
- You're not funny.
- Am too!

220
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:15,890
- Look. ln the field.
- What is it?

221
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,519
lt wasn't there before.

222
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,563
lt's some kind of spaceship, l think.

223
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,734
Hello?

224
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,070
Do you think
somebody's in there?

225
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:50,425
Uh-oh.
l didn't do it. You did it.

226
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,512
Run!
Run!

227
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:00,476
- Run! Run! Run!
- Monsters! Run! Run!

228
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,981
Monsters!

229
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:09,235
- Shaeeah? Jek? What's wrong?
- Monsters! They're chasing us!

230
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,779
What monsters, honey? Where?

231
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,658
They hatched from the big egg in the field!

232
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:23,082
Ah. This is not good. l count 20.

233
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,669
- Cut, what's out there?
- Commando droids.

234
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,004
What are they doing?

235
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,632
- Suu, get the kids upstairs.
- Come. Come, children. Come now!

236
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,846
What weapons do you have?

237
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,975
We can catch them in a crossfire.
You take that corner.

238
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,479
No, Captain.
With respect, you're not in charge here.

239
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,730
l can be useful.

240
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:49,400
Sir, you're injured.
You have only one good arm.

241
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,695
- But l can fight.
- So can l.

242
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:57,575
Rex, l need you
to be the last line of defense for my family.

243
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:05,041
- l'll take care of them.
- Thank you.

244
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:35,822
Finally!

245
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,035
General Grievous, sir. We see you
below us. Are you ready to depart?

246
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,747
Concentrate your fire on that ship!

247
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,920
Hey! They're shooting at us!
Coming back around.

248
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,551
Sir, that ship's coming around
for another landing attempt.

249
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,178
Keep firing! Don't let that ship land.

250
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,431
- The guns are overheated!
- Always something.

251
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,559
Cody, Jesse, cover me.

252
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,812
General, behind you!

253
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,679
Rex, they're coming for you!

254
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,501
Daddy? Daddy?

255
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,297
l'm okay. lt's over.

256
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,132
No!

257
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,391
Forget trying to land.

258
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,942
Fire the engines.

259
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,197
Jedi scum!

260
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:48,496
- Are you all right, sir?
- No. We're right back where we started.

261
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,624
Call the cruisers.
See if they can stop that ship.

262
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,833
Right away, sir!

263
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,544
And tell them to send someone
to pick us up.

264
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,512
All right, that should do it.

265
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:08,224
Captain Rex, are you going
to turn in my husband?

266
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,851
l'm sorry, Suu, it's my duty.

267
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,690
But in my condition,
l probably won't remember any of this.

268
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,233
Thank you.

269
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,861
You're still a deserter, Cut,
but you're certainly not a coward.

270
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,905
<i>Captain Rex,
are you still with us?</i>

271
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:27,034
Yes, General Kenobi. l'm still with you
and thankfully on the mend, sir.

272
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,204
That's great news.
We certainly missed you at the party.

273
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,541
Sorry, sir. l had to attend one of my own.

274
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,210
Can't wait to hear about it.
We're standing by.

275
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,090
- You're welcome to stay, Rex.
- This is your home, Cut.

276
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,551
My family is elsewhere.

277
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,387
- Goodbye!
- Bye!

278
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,603
- Bye!
- Bye-bye!
