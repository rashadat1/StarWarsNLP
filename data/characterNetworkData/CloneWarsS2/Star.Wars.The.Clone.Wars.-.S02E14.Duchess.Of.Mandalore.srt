1
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,853
<i>A diplomatic mission.</i>

2
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:25,024
<i>As dissent threatens to tear apart
the peaceful Mandalore system,</i>

3
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:30,070
<i>Duchess Satine struggles to protect
her people against the escalating violence.</i>

4
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:35,409
<i>Betrayed by two of her trusted allies,
Satine now travels to Coruscant.</i>

5
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,286
<i>There, she hopes to convince the Senate</i>

6
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,997
<i>that a destructive splinter group,
Death Watch,</i>

7
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:43,625
<i>does not represent
the entire Mandalorian government.</i>

8
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:55,095
With your Death Watch army in place,

9
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,892
now all we need do is to sit and wait.

10
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:03,270
<i>But for how long?
My men are anxious to fight.</i>

11
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:06,440
Considering the plot
we've just set in motion,

12
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:11,028
<i>l assure you the Republic will oblige you
the fight you're looking for.</i>

13
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:14,907
<i>First, send a Death Watch assassin
to Coruscant.</i>

14
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,868
<i>The Duchess of Mandalore must die.</i>

15
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,544
Prime Minister.

16
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:13,882
- You found the Death Watch armies, then?
- Yes, sir. They are preparing for battle.

17
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,050
But if they attack,

18
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:19,138
it would strengthen the people's resolve
not to join the Death Watch movement.

19
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,890
The Death Watch will never be
strong enough to take over Mandalore

20
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,559
without the will of the people.

21
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,645
Not if the Republic
has a military presence here.

22
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,482
Their occupation will turn the Death Watch
from terrorists to liberators

23
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,192
in the eyes of the people.

24
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,821
But how can we stop the Republic
from coming here?

25
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:40,159
Our fate now lies in the hands
of Duchess Satine.

26
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:51,336
lt grieves me to say it, but Death Watch
is now a significant, deadly threat.

27
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:56,175
Mandalore is making great strides to find
the leaders of this terrorist movement.

28
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,428
They are not powerful enough
to destabilize our government.

29
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,889
We will resolve this without conflict.

30
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:07,394
lf the Republic gets involved in our affairs
it will only lead to further violence.

31
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,564
Thus l shall reassert our position
of neutrality.

32
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:15,068
- Talk of an idealist.
- No, those are the words of a pacifist

33
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:18,614
and a people
who have chosen non-violent action.

34
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,449
That may be so, Duchess.

35
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,786
However, this message was delivered
to my staffjust this morning.

36
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,082
l think you shall find it most illuminating.

37
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:35,797
<i>The actions by our government
have taken us into a period of civil war.</i>

38
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,550
<i>To acknowledge it
would be to invite panic in the streets.</i>

39
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,220
- Duchess, do you know this man?
- <i>And so we hid the truth from our people.</i>

40
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:45,057
Yes. Deputy Minister Jerec.
He's a dear friend.

41
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:49,144
<i>lt is more than mere possibility,
more than eventuality.</i>

42
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,813
- <i>lt is here.</i>
- Stop!

43
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,816
Deputy Minister Jerec
is an honorable man.

44
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,402
He would never commit such lies
to the record.

45
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:01,323
The Mandalorian government
holds no secrets from its people.

46
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,408
lf only that were true.

47
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:08,080
<i>Death Watch is far stronger
than we once thought.</i>

48
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:13,168
<i>lf we are to combat them effectively,
we must have Republic assistance.</i>

49
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:17,798
<i>lnstead, this government acts out of pride
and rejects the help of the Jedi.</i>

50
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,424
lt's not true. lt's not true!

51
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,970
<i>The Duchess Satine
will ultimately cause our defeat.</i>

52
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:28,267
<i>Make no mistake, Republic intervention
is absolutely necessary.</i>

53
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:34,856
This isn't right. Something here isn't right!
l wish to speak to Jerec immediately.

54
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,194
Sadly, Deputy Minister Jerec
perished this morning

55
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,489
in a Death Watch bombing on Kalevala.

56
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:46,201
Let us ensure
that his death was not in vain.

57
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:50,205
Let us commit our military might
to defending the Mandalorian people.

58
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,542
Defending? You mean to occupy our home.

59
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:57,379
You would trample our right
to self-determination.

60
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,464
We mean to save your people.

61
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,050
You will turn our planet
into a military target

62
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,136
which will bring the war to us.

63
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,014
Mandalore must remain a neutral system.

64
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,851
The vote shall commence
in the next session.

65
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,396
Duchess!

66
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,898
Satine, wait.

67
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,821
l just heard what happened in the Senate.

68
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:28,201
You're sweet to be concerned.
But l promise l'll be all right.

69
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:31,204
l am concerned. We're friends, are we not?

70
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,250
Yes, friends and nothing more.

71
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,210
Satine, as your friend,

72
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,756
l don't think you should make
any decisions in this state of mind.

73
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:45,260
This state of mind? And what
state of mind would that be, precisely?

74
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,763
What l'm saying is...

75
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,931
Any person would be hysterical
by now, but...

76
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:53,643
Hysterical?
The Republic is attempting to force its will

77
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,271
- upon innocent people.
- l only meant...

78
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,940
Frankly, l'm surprised
you're not hysterical.

79
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:03,445
Perhaps if more citizens got hysterical,
they'd be more inclined to speak up

80
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,073
when the Republic tramples
on their rights.

81
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,824
Rushing in like this, it's...

82
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,951
lt's foolhardy.

83
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:14,122
lronic words from a man who spends
his days running hither and yon,

84
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:18,335
wielding his lightsaber with deadly force
as if on a crusade.

85
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:22,422
Why should l listen to someone
who so frequently relies on violence?

86
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,634
ln my opinion,
you're the one who's foolhardy.

87
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,038
- What's happening?
- lt's the navigation system.

88
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,501
Get her out of here.

89
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,175
There's a platform ahead.
l'll try to get closer.

90
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,719
No, stop! Aramis!

91
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,347
Jump!

92
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:31,032
What do you mean,
no charges are to be filed? None at all?

93
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,909
Someone tried to kill me.

94
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,871
The controls on my speeder
were compromised.

95
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:40,250
Sadly, my dear, there is no proof
anyone tampered with anything.

96
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,295
l'm afraid it might have been
just an accident.

97
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,504
An accident?

98
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,091
And it just happened to coincide
with me defending my home world?

99
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,553
- l agree with Satine.
- Well! Finally.

100
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,847
lt proves what l've been saying all along.

101
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:58,393
Death Watch is out of control.
The Republic must step in and help.

102
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,561
No. Wait, l didn't...

103
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:04,107
You can't keep them reined in, obviously,
so we will.

104
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:08,236
This is patently offensive.
You can't do this.

105
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,239
Unfortunately, it is up to the Senate now.

106
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:15,076
l'm sure they'll make
a reasoned and thoughtful decision.

107
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,462
Satine, l just heard about your accident.

108
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,963
Those two are...

109
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,548
This government will...

110
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,593
Satine, tell me what happened!

111
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,304
l'm fine. l wasn't hurt.

112
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,264
l didn't want to worry you.

113
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,018
Well, l'm afraid on that count
you failed spectacularly.

114
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,730
- Look what happened.
- Look what happened?

115
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:48,443
This attack proves l've upset someone.
l must be on the right track.

116
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,364
This attack proves your enemies are here
even on Coruscant.

117
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,701
You're not going to let Republic authorities
handle this, are you?

118
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:01,206
- You're not backing down.
- Republic authorities? Certainly not.

119
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,750
l'm on my way
to the Ministry of lntelligence right now

120
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,669
to meet my contact.

121
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,587
Don't you see?

122
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,299
You need your friends with you,
not held at arm's length.

123
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,009
ln your quest to be self-reliant,

124
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,721
have you decided
to cut your friends out of your life?

125
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,140
l don't know.

126
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,394
Senator, what is it?

127
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:26,439
The Senate completed its vote.
They've decided in favor of occupation.

128
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:30,944
When did this happen?
The vote was supposed to be tomorrow.

129
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,196
lt was during your meeting
with the Chancellor.

130
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,991
Your accident
accelerated the Senate's decision.

131
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,911
Republic forces are set to leave
for Mandalore at sunrise tomorrow.

132
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,247
You see? l was right before.

133
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,043
Counting on the Republic is a mistake.

134
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,368
l don't have much time.
They're following me.

135
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:29,169
You've put yourself in great danger.
l'll never forget it.

136
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,671
l had to come. This is worth it.

137
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,674
Where did you get this?

138
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,802
Buried deep in the evidence facility
at the Ministry.

139
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,804
lt was not easy to find, believe me.

140
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,855
You were right.
Someone faked the evidence.

141
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:52,484
The recording presented to the Senate
was not the full recording.

142
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,904
But this disk is.
You must show the Senate...

143
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,992
Davu!

144
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,995
No.

145
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,754
<i>We have a shooting
in Sector GL-5.</i>

146
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,674
<i>Subject identified
as Duchess Satine Kryze.</i>

147
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,596
Hands where we can see them.
You are coming with us.

148
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,515
l didn't kill him.

149
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:28,019
<i>Subject identified
as Duchess Satine Kryze.</i>

150
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,825
We spotted her.
She's heading into the alley.

151
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,999
Cancel that. She's escaping in a speeder,
heading for section l-G-44.

152
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:50,143
<i>Duchess Satine escaped again,
but l took out an informant.</i>

153
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,271
Not sure if he successfully
delivered something to her,

154
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,231
but it looked like a handoff.

155
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:59,277
<i>Find her. Whatever she's carrying
may compromise our plan.</i>

156
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:17,378
My lord, everything is going
as you instructed.

157
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,131
<i>Death Watch is prepared to fight?</i>

158
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:24,677
Yes. The people have been worked
into such a frenzy

159
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,639
that when the Republic does arrive,

160
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:31,309
the Death Watch
will be considered heroes.

161
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,685
<i>Excellent.</i>

162
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:37,690
<i>The Republic occupation force is
loading their ships and will arrive on time,</i>

163
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,528
<i>if the Duchess Satine
does not get in the way.</i>

164
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,573
The Duchess Satine
will not be in the way much longer.

165
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,077
One of the Death Watch assassins
is taking care of her.

166
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:57,627
Uh, excuse me, sir. lf you see this woman,
report her to the local authorities.

167
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,842
Uh... You know, l don't think he
understands us. Let's try someone else.

168
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,762
Obi-Wan, come in.

169
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,306
<i>Obi-Wan, are you there?</i>

170
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,642
Satine! Where are you?

171
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,311
Mas Amedda has demanded
you turn yourself in.

172
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,897
<i>l know. Listen to me. Obi-Wan,</i>

173
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,899
l need your help.

174
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,753
Have you seen this woman?

175
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,391
Nice disguise.

176
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,819
Seeing you all right is...

177
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,863
Well, it's a relief.

178
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,990
You should turn yourself in.

179
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,743
We've both sworn a loyalty
to the Republic.

180
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,996
Believe me, neither one of us
is breaking our oath.

181
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,042
And this will prove it.
l need to get it into the proper hands.

182
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,672
But the Republic guards are hunting you,
which means...

183
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:28,343
Whoever doctored this recording
is likely in the government itself.

184
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,095
lf you set foot inside the Senate,
they'll take you.

185
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,849
And the disk will be destroyed
before anyone can see it.

186
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,352
Which is why
you must take the disk to Padmé.

187
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,038
Blast it.

188
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,004
Where will you be while l'm in the Senate?

189
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,048
- What if they find you?
- They won't.

190
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,926
- l'm going to surrender to them.
- What?

191
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,054
You'll need a distraction
to enter the Senate freely.

192
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:17,225
l can't risk them searching you
just because you and l are associates.

193
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:22,188
- l'm a Jedi. They wouldn't dare.
- Things are changing, my dear.

194
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,563
Obi!

195
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:37,388
Excuse me.
l believe you were looking for me?

196
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:54,989
The occupation of Mandalore will usher in
a new level of security for the Republic

197
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,825
and its fight against corruption.

198
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:01,329
- lf there are no objections...
- Supreme Chancellor.

199
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,457
There has been a development
in the case for Mandalore's neutrality.

200
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,460
The chair recognizes
the senator from Naboo.

201
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,756
l think this should cast a new light
on the so-called evidence we saw earlier.

202
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:23,142
<i>The actions by our government
have taken us into a period of civil war.</i>

203
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:27,021
<i>To acknowledge it
would be to invite panic in the streets.</i>

204
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,358
<i>Death Watch is far stronger
than we once thought.</i>

205
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:34,445
<i>But we have been training for this.
We can stop them.</i>

206
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,697
<i>But if we are to combat them effectively,</i>

207
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:40,952
<i>we must have the temerity
to stand strong in the name of peace.</i>

208
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:46,791
<i>And if we are to do so,
we must reject any Republic assistance.</i>

209
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:51,212
<i>lnstead, this government will act.</i>

210
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,590
<i>lt acts not out of pride, but for safety.</i>

211
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,387
<i>lntervention by the Republic
will inflame the opposition,</i>

212
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:03,432
<i>and this is why our government
rejects the help of the Jedi.</i>

213
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,644
<i>We must listen to the Duchess Satine.</i>

214
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:11,399
<i>lf we do not,
we will ultimately cause our defeat.</i>

215
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,485
<i>All troops will stand down.</i>

216
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,029
<i>All troops will stand down!</i>

217
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,991
Unacceptable! You promised us

218
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:24,245
we would reclaim Mandalore
from these weak-willed cowards!

219
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,247
l will order my men to attack.

220
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:30,293
And if you do,
you'll hold the planet for perhaps a day.

221
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,630
Without the backing of my forces
or your people,

222
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,925
your revolution will be over
before it begins.

223
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:43,181
A neophyte such as you
wouldn't know these things, but l do.

224
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,435
l have other ways to accomplish our goal.

225
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,614
Thankfully, with the revelation
of this new information,

226
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,117
the occupation of Mandalore
is no longer necessary.

227
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,288
The person to thank is Duchess Satine.
She found the proof.

228
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,332
l require no thanks.

229
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,837
Satine, the Senate held
an emergency session,

230
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:18,257
and the Republic forces
have been ordered to stand down.

231
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:23,012
Allow me to offer a most sincere apology
on behalf of the entire Republic.

232
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:28,476
You are a most loyal servant,
and we are all grateful.

233
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,978
Yes. Grateful.

234
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,816
Chancellor, if you and Mas Amedda
would join me for a moment,

235
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,654
we have some logistics to discuss
in order to ratify the Senate's decision.

236
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,991
But for you, this wouldn't have happened.

237
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:48,663
No, it was your unshakable faith
in your people, and your determination,

238
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:52,333
- that brought about this result.
- l appreciate that.

239
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,838
But still, who is behind all of this?
Who tampered with that recording?

240
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,259
Who tried to convict me of murder
and throw me in jail?

241
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:06,514
l'm not sure, but as you said yourself,
things are changing.

242
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:11,602
And sometimes the line
between friend and foe is blurred.

243
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,479
Now more than ever.
