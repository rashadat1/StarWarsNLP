1
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,935
<i>Revenge!</i>

2
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,522
<i>Boba Fett, son of the notorious
bounty hunter Jango Fett,</i>

3
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:28,444
<i>infiltrated a Jedi cruiser in an attempt
to assassinate General Mace Windu,</i>

4
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,155
<i>the man who killed his father.</i>

5
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,449
<i>After a near miss at Windu's quarters,</i>

6
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,826
<i>Boba was forced
to destroy the Jedi cruiser</i>

7
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:39,663
<i>and escape with the help
of notorious bounty hunter Aurra Sing.</i>

8
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>Now, having lost contact
with Admiral Kilian</i>

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,502
<i>when his doomed starship crashed,</i>

10
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:50,007
<i>the Jedi search for survivors
with the aid of a Republic rescue ship.</i>

11
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,972
General Windu, we're picking up
the last of the survivors now.

12
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,267
lt's critical to get them
to a hospital station as soon as possible.

13
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,562
We'll contact you as soon as our search
for Admiral Kilian is complete.

14
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,523
Let's go, Artoo.

15
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,369
We're coming up on the crash site.
Let's hope Admiral Kilian

16
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,997
and the command crew
are still in one piece.

17
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,339
Hmm. Looks pretty bad,
but the bridge seems to be intact.

18
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,509
Set down behind the cruiser,
we'll approach on foot.

19
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,485
You're not kidding,
little buddy.

20
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,529
l don't like the feel of this place either.

21
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,281
Your astromech is programmed to feel?

22
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:01,703
Artoo is kind of a special case.
He's got a lot of personality, that's all.

23
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,040
You encourage it too much.

24
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:20,514
R8, start scanning the area for signs of life
and calculate an entry point to the cruiser.

25
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,604
You're right, Artoo, it doesn't look good.

26
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,700
- A bit jittery, isn't it?
- He must have seen something.

27
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,872
Come on,
it looks like R8 has found an entry point.

28
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,840
There would have been a command crew
left aboard to try and land this ship.

29
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:58,177
Admiral Kilian and then
at least three navigational officers.

30
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,053
Commander Ponds stayed as well.

31
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,408
What did you find, little guy?

32
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,786
Mace, over here!

33
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:34,796
Hmm. This man did not die in the crash,
he was executed.

34
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,759
There's another one over here.
Same thing.

35
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:43,889
We know the assassins were after me.
Perhaps they returned to look for my body.

36
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:47,142
We need to get to the bridge
to find Admiral Kilian.

37
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,187
Send the droids to scan
for any survivors down here.

38
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,730
Maybe the killer missed one.

39
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,982
l know there's a lot of interference,

40
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,692
but do your best.

41
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,152
Skywalker!

42
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:37,776
They're dead.
Executed like the troopers below.

43
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,239
But l don't see Admiral Kilian
or Commander Ponds.

44
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,701
They must have been sucked into space
when the cabin lost pressure.

45
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:53,083
<i>Captain, there's no sign
of any life down here.</i>

46
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,420
<i>l'm afraid Admiral Kilian
and Commander Ponds are lost.</i>

47
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,340
Take the survivors back to the
hospital station. We'll meet you there.

48
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,801
- <i>Mace out.</i>
- Captain Silver out.

49
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,220
Head for home. Light speed.

50
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,947
ls that a Mandalorian helmet?

51
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,333
What is that doing here?

52
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,462
Clone cadets.

53
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,092
Jango Fett.

54
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,679
Boba!

55
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:34,142
Anakin! No! Drop it!

56
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,002
Mace is dead. Are you happy now?

57
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,217
l want to make sure he's dead.

58
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,803
There's nothing left of Windu to find, Boba.

59
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,181
l want to get off this planet now.

60
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,893
This place is crawling with gundarks,

61
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,814
and besides, we've got these hostages
to drag along with us now.

62
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:25,068
This extra baggage will fetch us
a hefty sum from the Separatists.

63
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:29,656
Well, it's a lot of trouble
for not enough payout, if you ask me.

64
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:34,077
You haven't even done anything!
l've taken all the risks.

65
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,620
Quiet, runt.

66
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,499
l wouldn't do that.

67
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:46,590
Count Dooku will pay us well
if we bring back the Jedi's head.

68
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,551
Dooku might pay us for killing Windu.

69
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,386
Then we're looking at a profit.

70
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,472
Well...

71
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:57,517
Now, relax. Boba is right.

72
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,395
To get paid,
we need proof of Windu's death,

73
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,982
and if we killed Skywalker,
we can ask for double.

74
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:09,196
- Double?
- Yes, but we need proof.

75
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,867
Bossk, take care of our guests
while we're gone.

76
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,944
Artoo! Over here!

77
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,577
Good to see you, buddy.

78
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,669
Careful, Artoo.
l'm afraid the whole bridge will collapse.

79
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:11,258
l need you to go back to the fighters
and call the Temple for help, okay?

80
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,302
Okay?

81
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,684
Go get help.
We'll hold out as long as we can.

82
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,144
Go on, Artoo.

83
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,564
Go on.

84
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,844
Come on. We've got to find Windu's body.

85
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,389
Careful, Boba.

86
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:12,902
Yeah, careful. l'd hate
to only split the money three ways.

87
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,806
Look out!

88
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,146
This place is a death trap!

89
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:53,068
When l hired you, l didn't realize
that you were such a coward.

90
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,112
Well, l don't want to be next.

91
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,911
- Blast!
- The door must have malfunctioned.

92
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:17,425
Skywalker? Skywalker, are you all right?

93
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:22,555
Yeah, l'm okay.
Except l can't move.

94
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,100
Can you get free?

95
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,902
l already tried that.

96
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,946
You'll bring the whole place down on us.

97
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:42,534
Well, how do we plan
on getting ourselves out of this mess?

98
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:47,080
Don't worry. l already sent Artoo
back to the fighters to call for help.

99
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,249
l'm sure he has everything under control.

100
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,792
Mmm.

101
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,672
l'm just saying, l didn't know
there'd be all this climbing involved.

102
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,967
Shut up already. lt wasn't my idea
for you to tag along anyway.

103
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:03,012
The next one who says anything
will get a blaster bolt through the brain.

104
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,640
But, Aurra...
Not one more word.

105
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,449
lncoming!

106
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,539
- What was that?
- The ship is falling apart around us.

107
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,916
This is no good.

108
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:36,379
lf we can barely survive in here,
Windu must have been killed in the blast.

109
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,507
l'm not quitting now.
Not when l'm so close.

110
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,690
Look out!

111
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,444
We're running out of time.

112
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:05,617
That's it. We're out of here.
No one could survive this place.

113
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,202
A Jedi could.

114
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,789
l hate to agree with Castas,
but there is a better way to do this.

115
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,290
But, Aurra...

116
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,381
Bossk, fire up <i>Slave l</i>.

117
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,927
<i>We're going to blast
what's left of this ship to pieces.</i>

118
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,930
l'll be ready when you arrive.

119
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:40,652
- l hate just sitting here.
- Calm yourself, Skywalker.

120
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,657
We'll soon see if the faith you put
in that droid is worth it.

121
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,163
What was that?

122
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:40,879
Scanners picked up an explosion
near where the Jedi landed.

123
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,549
- Windu.
- Jam any communications off this planet.

124
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:12,368
- The fighter's markings match Windu's.
- l knew it! l told you he wasn't dead.

125
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,995
Bossk, after him.

126
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,009
l don't like the sound of that.

127
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,720
Artoo?

128
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:35,141
l thought your astromech
was supposed to call for help,

129
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,518
not take off and leave us here.

130
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,567
Come on, Artoo, l'm counting on you.

131
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,001
Hold it steady.

132
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,926
We've knocked out his communications.

133
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,733
Two rings, mark three-five,
they're powering up.

134
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,652
lf we can take out the rings,
he'll be trapped.

135
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,280
- Which one?
- Destroy them both!

136
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:36,244
We can't get range.
You'll get one shot at this, kid.

137
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,918
l've got you, Windu.

138
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,882
No!

139
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,764
Well, there goes a fortune. Nice work, kid.

140
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,271
What's our next move?

141
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,523
Great! Well, this has gone well.

142
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:11,320
Windu will be back here with a fleet.
He'll hunt us down.

143
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,699
Don't count on it.
The Jedi don't carry grudges.

144
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,204
But l have ways of motivating him.

145
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,960
We'll make Windu come to us next time,
on our terms.

146
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,130
Now, let's get out of here.
l want to regroup.

147
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:51,319
We shall reinforce our fleet
along the Hydian Way,

148
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:55,823
this should prevent Grievous from...

149
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,992
Artoo?

150
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,169
Stop it! Artoo, what's wrong?

151
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:14,967
- Ahsoka, you know this droid?
- lt's Anakin's droid, R2-D2.

152
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:21,057
Well, then, Artoo, deliver the message
you so obviously need to communicate.

153
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:28,147
<i>l need you to go back to the fighters
and call the Temple for help, okay?</i>

154
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,025
<i>Okay?</i>

155
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,778
Prepare my ship.
We shall leave immediately.

156
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,210
Whose helmet is that anyway?

157
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,880
lt belongs to a bounty hunter
l killed on Geonosis,

158
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,216
by the name of Jango Fett.

159
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,636
You mean the clone template?

160
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,348
Yes. Strangely enough he had a son,

161
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,893
or at least a clone he regarded as a son.

162
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,688
His name is Boba Fett.

163
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:13,025
l remember now. Obi-Wan listed him
in his report on Kamino.

164
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,946
Boba was on Geonosis
when his father died.

165
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,407
He watched as l killed him.

166
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:24,245
- That would complicate things.
- lndeed.

167
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,260
Your astromech has been gone too long.

168
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,596
He must have failed
to deliver your message.

169
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,640
Artoo will come through.

170
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,452
There! ln the bridge, l can see them.

171
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,414
Ahsoka, hold the ship steady.

172
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,300
Comet! Let's go!

173
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,223
Hurry, Commander Wolffe!

174
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:26,891
Hold tight, General.

175
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,267
We're losing it, sir.

176
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,318
Jump!

177
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,446
Cut the lines!

178
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:42,907
Go!

179
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,177
Some pretty serious burns,

180
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,429
but nothing
a night in the bacta tank won't fix.

181
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,516
Oh, sorry.

182
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,185
We were lucky to arrive when we did.

183
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,312
Guess we have Artoo to thank for that.

184
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,483
Come here, droid.

185
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,863
l can see why your master trusts you,
little one.

186
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,074
Good job.

187
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,707
That's definitely more praise
than l ever get.

188
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,874
Mmm.
