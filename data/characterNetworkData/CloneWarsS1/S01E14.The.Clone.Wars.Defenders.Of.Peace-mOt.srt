1
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,691
<i>Republic forces in retreat!</i>

2
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,970
<i>While rescuing General Aayla Secura
from certain defeat,</i>

3
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,730
<i>Anakin Skywalker
has been seriously injured.</i>

4
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,450
<i>After a narrow escape,
our heroes crash-landed</i>

5
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,530
<i>on the remote world of Maridun.</i>

6
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:32,089
<i>Stranded, and with no way
to contact the Republic,</i>

7
00:00:32,209 --> 00:00:35,529
<i>the Jedi receive medical aid
from the peaceful Lurmen colonists.</i>

8
00:00:35,648 --> 00:00:39,328
<i>But even on this tiny planet,
the war threatens to follow the Jedi.</i>

9
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:05,765
Commander Bly, we've got company.

10
00:01:06,285 --> 00:01:08,244
- Friendlies?
- Negative, sir.

11
00:01:08,365 --> 00:01:09,405
A droid ship...

12
00:01:09,885 --> 00:01:11,525
<i>coming straight our way.</i>

13
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:13,484
Acknowledged.
Get back here.

14
00:01:16,724 --> 00:01:18,524
- General?
- Yes, Commander?

15
00:01:18,803 --> 00:01:20,643
We've got a Separatist ship
incoming.

16
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:22,523
This is neutral space.

17
00:01:22,643 --> 00:01:25,802
It won't be neutral for long,
not if the Separatists have their way.

18
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:29,282
- Help me up.
- Don't struggle.

19
00:01:29,682 --> 00:01:32,442
I'm sorry,
but you're still too injured to move.

20
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,240
What menace have you brought
to our village now, Jedi?

21
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:46,600
Father, you can't blame them.

22
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,559
He's right. The Separatists
don't even know we're here.

23
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,960
And they can't know.
We've got to hide.

24
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,359
Your presence here endangers us.

25
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:56,599
You must leave
before your enemies find you.

26
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:59,759
But you'll need our help.
You can't fight them alone.

27
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:02,038
We will not fight them at all.

28
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:04,118
We would rather die
than to kill others.

29
00:02:04,477 --> 00:02:06,198
You're going to surrender?

30
00:02:06,557 --> 00:02:08,838
- But how can you...
- Ahsoka, stop.

31
00:02:09,237 --> 00:02:12,996
If the Lurmen want to remain neutral,
we won't force them into war.

32
00:02:13,556 --> 00:02:15,076
See to it that they leave.

33
00:02:15,476 --> 00:02:17,796
I must see
what our new visitors want.

34
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:33,074
Take it easy, sir.
We'll assist you.

35
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:44,553
I am General Lok Durd

36
00:02:44,673 --> 00:02:46,393
of the Separatist alliance.

37
00:02:46,673 --> 00:02:49,472
I am Tee Watt Kaa,
leader of this colony.

38
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,432
- What do you...
- You are now under the protection

39
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:54,352
of the Separatist alliance.

40
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:56,432
I congratulate you

41
00:02:56,712 --> 00:02:58,191
on your good fortune.

42
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:02,671
Thank you, but we enjoyed good fortune
well before your arrival.

43
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,510
We are a peaceful people, General.

44
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,630
I do not condone your presence here.

45
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,069
Then stand aside.

46
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,349
I would like to inspect
my new colony.

47
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:23,189
Ransack this dung heap.

48
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:32,267
Why are they tearing apart
our homes?

49
00:03:32,387 --> 00:03:34,187
We've done nothing to them!

50
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:35,347
Violence...

51
00:03:35,587 --> 00:03:37,746
that's what those droids
are programmed for.

52
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:41,426
Can't we do anything?

53
00:03:41,826 --> 00:03:45,106
No, and if we are discovered,
all of the Lurmen will be slaughtered.

54
00:03:45,786 --> 00:03:48,545
We'll be okay
if we make it to the tall grasses.

55
00:03:59,664 --> 00:04:03,263
There is no evidence of any weapons
or Republic contraband, General.

56
00:04:03,904 --> 00:04:07,583
In the future, we may conduct
more periodic searches

57
00:04:07,743 --> 00:04:11,382
like this one
in order to maintain security.

58
00:04:11,902 --> 00:04:14,702
Because we are
such an obvious threat to you.

59
00:04:15,582 --> 00:04:16,981
We'll offer no resistance.

60
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:20,222
Your species is smarter
than you appear.

61
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:30,220
Father, are you okay?

62
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,099
At least the Jedi escaped.

63
00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:39,419
Yes, but they nearly brought harm
to our entire village.

64
00:04:40,299 --> 00:04:41,658
But now, thanks to you,

65
00:04:41,818 --> 00:04:45,138
we're safe to grovel before every
petty tyrant who enters our system.

66
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,498
You would mock our very way of life?

67
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:49,658
I have just ensured
we will have peace.

68
00:04:50,017 --> 00:04:52,578
Yes, but for the moment,
and at what price?

69
00:04:53,097 --> 00:04:55,737
Are you not concerned
about the Jedi at all?

70
00:04:55,937 --> 00:04:57,976
I have no quarrel with the Jedi,

71
00:04:58,337 --> 00:05:01,176
but we cannot help them
without being drawn into their war.

72
00:05:04,656 --> 00:05:06,096
Tub, track the Jedi.

73
00:05:06,495 --> 00:05:09,135
Follow them
and make sure they get off-world.

74
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:18,014
You know, I can't figure those villagers
not wanting to fight.

75
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:19,414
No pride, I guess.

76
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:21,374
I call it no courage.

77
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:25,654
Sometimes it takes courage to stick
to one's beliefs, young Padawan,

78
00:05:25,813 --> 00:05:27,413
as any Jedi well knows.

79
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:29,613
We need to find a ship,

80
00:05:29,932 --> 00:05:32,812
and I think the only one around here
belongs to the Separatists.

81
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,492
We know they have a landing ship.
They might have a shuttle.

82
00:05:37,252 --> 00:05:40,452
Sir, you talking about stealing
from one of the clankers?

83
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:43,571
- Count me in.
- We need to find them first.

84
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:47,131
I think we just did.

85
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,810
Blast it!

86
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:53,330
Jam its signal!

87
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,730
After it!

88
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:01,089
I'm fine. Just go!

89
00:06:08,288 --> 00:06:10,768
- Which way did it go?
- This way. Hurry!

90
00:06:31,165 --> 00:06:33,165
We can't catch it
if it gets out in the open.

91
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:49,403
- I wonder where it was headed.
- Maybe we can see them from up there.

92
00:06:55,802 --> 00:06:58,042
I hope you're feeling better,
Master,

93
00:06:58,442 --> 00:06:59,842
'cause look what we found.

94
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,921
I'm getting stronger
all the time, Snips.

95
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:07,561
But I'm not sure
I'm ready for that.

96
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,158
That shuttle is
our ticket off this rock.

97
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:31,758
It's not gonna be easy, sir.

98
00:07:31,878 --> 00:07:35,078
There don't seem to be any flaws
in their security line.

99
00:07:51,156 --> 00:07:53,476
Apparently,
the Separatists have a new toy.

100
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:55,875
- See if you can get a closer look.
- Yes, sir.

101
00:07:55,995 --> 00:07:57,795
I'll go with you, Commander.

102
00:08:03,954 --> 00:08:06,433
Is the defoliator capsule ready?

103
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:12,393
Today is a grand day
for the Separatist cause.

104
00:08:13,313 --> 00:08:15,433
We test a new weapon

105
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,753
of my own design

106
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:22,191
which is capable
of catastrophic destruction.

107
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:26,431
A weapon which will destroy
organic matter

108
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:29,391
but leave machines

109
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:30,950
unharmed.

110
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,190
But first,

111
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,710
we need two volunteers.

112
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,469
The volunteers are...

113
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:46,549
...you and you.

114
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:48,189
- Me?
- Me?

115
00:08:48,668 --> 00:08:49,869
Go to that ridge.

116
00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:51,748
- Roger, roger.
- Roger, roger.

117
00:08:59,107 --> 00:09:00,107
Stay down, boys.

118
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:04,467
Count Dooku,

119
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:07,626
I have located a world
in which we can test my...

120
00:09:08,306 --> 00:09:09,506
Excuse me.

121
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:11,545
...our new weapon.

122
00:09:13,065 --> 00:09:16,025
<i>I hope it turns out
to be worth the expense.</i>

123
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,745
<i>You may proceed.</i>

124
00:09:18,545 --> 00:09:20,425
Yes, my Lord.
Ready?

125
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:22,745
Roger, roger.

126
00:09:23,144 --> 00:09:23,865
Aim.

127
00:09:27,144 --> 00:09:27,864
Fire!

128
00:09:34,903 --> 00:09:36,382
Should we take cover?

129
00:09:36,503 --> 00:09:38,622
No, idiot.
That is not even gonna hit us.

130
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,581
That's some toy.

131
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,740
It took out every living thing.

132
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,020
As you can see,

133
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,539
the landscape has been destroyed,

134
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:10,698
and the droids are undamaged.

135
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:12,419
<i>Impressive.</i>

136
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:14,464
<i>But now, we need to know</i>

137
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:17,298
<i>how effective
this weapon will be against...</i>

138
00:10:17,498 --> 00:10:18,777
<i>living creatures.</i>

139
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:20,457
Of course.

140
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:24,737
I specifically chose this planet
because it is inhabited.

141
00:10:25,336 --> 00:10:28,656
The colonists will make
excellent test subjects.

142
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:30,376
<i>Proceed, then.</i>

143
00:10:30,976 --> 00:10:33,096
<i>I eagerly await the results.</i>

144
00:10:34,616 --> 00:10:36,335
Prepare to move out!

145
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:39,176
Where are they off to now?

146
00:10:39,295 --> 00:10:41,775
They must be going back
to the Lurmen village.

147
00:10:41,895 --> 00:10:43,815
There's nothing else
in that direction.

148
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,134
Those villagers
won't stand a chance.

149
00:10:46,254 --> 00:10:48,494
First we'll take out
the droids' communication station.

150
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,814
After we get a shuttle,
we'll go back and help them.

151
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:54,374
But Tee Watt Kaa said
he doesn't need our help.

152
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:57,373
There's a difference
between pulling innocents into a war

153
00:10:57,493 --> 00:10:59,092
and leaving them to extinction.

154
00:11:08,531 --> 00:11:11,371
Tell Wag Too
the Separatists are returning.

155
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:35,928
Hey, what was that?

156
00:12:01,326 --> 00:12:03,765
Get to the door.
I'll handle the droids.

157
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:39,480
Check the exterior.

158
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,320
We cannot have any surprises
for the general.

159
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,000
4724, how does the west end
check out?

160
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,159
What the...?

161
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,799
The Separatists are on the march.
They're returning to our village.

162
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:55,918
They did not attack us before.

163
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:58,239
There's no reason to think
they will this time.

164
00:12:58,358 --> 00:13:00,198
Father, they wouldn't be
coming back here

165
00:13:00,318 --> 00:13:03,398
unless they intended to do us harm.
This is war!

166
00:13:03,678 --> 00:13:05,078
But not our war.

167
00:13:05,557 --> 00:13:07,277
We've done nothing to provoke them,

168
00:13:07,397 --> 00:13:09,197
and we will not.
That is their way.

169
00:13:09,517 --> 00:13:11,677
So we will just lay down
and be slaughtered?

170
00:13:11,797 --> 00:13:14,116
Father, even if we don't fight
the Separatists,

171
00:13:14,236 --> 00:13:15,796
we must defend ourselves!

172
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:18,835
Mounting a defense
is still engaging in battle.

173
00:13:18,956 --> 00:13:22,315
If we sacrifice our beliefs,
we're no better than they are.

174
00:13:22,555 --> 00:13:25,395
Our philosophy has helped us
to survive for generations,

175
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:28,395
and we will not change
our morals now or ever.

176
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,233
- Shield generators, sir.
- Let's take 'em with us.

177
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:13,949
Everyone,
please, please listen.

178
00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:15,989
The Separatists will be here
in moments.

179
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:19,228
What are you doing here?
I told you not to return.

180
00:14:19,668 --> 00:14:22,668
I'm afraid the Separatists don't care
whether you're in the war or not.

181
00:14:22,948 --> 00:14:24,988
We need to get you to safety
before they arrive.

182
00:14:25,308 --> 00:14:27,147
We will not abandon our homes.

183
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:31,106
But they've got a new weapon.
It'll burn this place to a crisp.

184
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,787
Is this what all of you really want?

185
00:14:34,146 --> 00:14:37,026
If it is our destiny to be destroyed
in your war,

186
00:14:37,786 --> 00:14:38,706
so be it.

187
00:14:48,185 --> 00:14:50,425
Droids inbound.
We've got eight minutes tops.

188
00:14:50,545 --> 00:14:52,944
Come on, guys. Let's get
these shield generators in place!

189
00:15:00,263 --> 00:15:02,543
When Count Dooku sees
how successful

190
00:15:02,663 --> 00:15:05,023
my weapon is
against civilian targets,

191
00:15:05,382 --> 00:15:08,422
I will no doubt be promoted
to a more...

192
00:15:09,022 --> 00:15:11,742
...substantial position
within the alliance.

193
00:15:13,582 --> 00:15:14,341
Right.

194
00:15:14,942 --> 00:15:18,221
Well, the villagers appear
to have put some pods together

195
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:20,861
- in a barrier around the village.
- Pods?

196
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:24,340
How quaint.

197
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,660
Jedi?

198
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,260
What are they doing out here?
Halt!

199
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,859
Pray stop what you're doing.

200
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:38,578
Stop building that wall.

201
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:41,979
- I did not ask you to defend us.
- This battle is inevitable.

202
00:15:42,418 --> 00:15:45,618
You can stand by your beliefs,
but let us stand by ours.

203
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:50,857
Thank you
for what you're trying to do.

204
00:15:51,057 --> 00:15:53,977
I'm sorry, but I cannot help.
My father is very...

205
00:15:54,937 --> 00:15:57,016
...strong-willed and set in tradition.

206
00:15:57,497 --> 00:15:58,936
Many others agree with me,

207
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:01,256
but we were raised
under a very strict code.

208
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:03,975
We must respect it,
even if we don't agree.

209
00:16:07,815 --> 00:16:10,375
- They're holding position.
- They're not going to charge us,

210
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,774
not if they can hit us
from long range first.

211
00:16:12,894 --> 00:16:16,014
But if we can withstand that weapon,
we'll draw them in.

212
00:16:16,294 --> 00:16:17,654
Prepare to fire!

213
00:16:25,612 --> 00:16:27,173
Good-bye, Jedi.

214
00:16:27,893 --> 00:16:28,652
Fire!

215
00:16:31,652 --> 00:16:32,572
Incoming!

216
00:16:34,852 --> 00:16:35,972
Power the shields!

217
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:05,128
Now they'll have to get their hands
dirty and meet us face-to-face.

218
00:17:05,528 --> 00:17:07,808
Squad one, prepare to charge.

219
00:17:08,248 --> 00:17:09,367
Prepare to charge.

220
00:17:11,688 --> 00:17:12,527
Charge!

221
00:17:16,246 --> 00:17:17,927
That's a lot of clankers.

222
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:20,366
We got to stop them
before they get through that shield.

223
00:17:46,963 --> 00:17:48,363
Five, four,

224
00:17:49,043 --> 00:17:49,803
three,

225
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:50,802
two,

226
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:52,003
one,

227
00:17:52,803 --> 00:17:53,562
zero.

228
00:17:53,923 --> 00:17:56,402
Sir, the first squad
has been destroyed.

229
00:17:57,801 --> 00:17:59,802
Squad two and three, attack!

230
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:03,641
- That wasn't so tough.
- That was just the first wave.

231
00:18:10,521 --> 00:18:12,200
Snips, get back to the village!

232
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,360
I'll take care of the new weapon.

233
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:20,119
That's it. We have to retreat!

234
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:27,038
Take cover.
They've breached the shield!

235
00:18:33,037 --> 00:18:34,837
They're taking out
the shield generators.

236
00:18:34,957 --> 00:18:36,117
We have to do something.

237
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,755
Their shield is down.
Launch another shell.

238
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,594
Sir, there's a Jedi
heading right for us.

239
00:19:04,193 --> 00:19:06,314
Then blast him, you idiot!

240
00:19:12,992 --> 00:19:14,032
No survivors.

241
00:19:17,512 --> 00:19:19,352
Wag Too, what are you doing?

242
00:19:19,632 --> 00:19:21,911
- We're going to help.
- I forbid this.

243
00:19:22,151 --> 00:19:23,671
What more would you have them do

244
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,751
before we are allowed
to defend ourselves?

245
00:19:26,151 --> 00:19:27,711
- But...
- We have to do this.

246
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:49,748
Help!

247
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:51,628
I'll be defoliated!

248
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:03,667
There goes my promotion.

249
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:07,186
The weapon has been disabled.

250
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:08,866
Copy that, General.

251
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,742
- Thank you, Wag Too.
- Thank you.

252
00:20:38,902 --> 00:20:41,062
Our village would certainly
have been destroyed

253
00:20:41,182 --> 00:20:43,142
without your protection.
Father,

254
00:20:43,302 --> 00:20:45,381
I was just offering the Jedi
our thanks.

255
00:20:45,502 --> 00:20:47,381
Perhaps we do owe you thanks.

256
00:20:47,941 --> 00:20:49,341
But I still wonder,

257
00:20:49,861 --> 00:20:51,420
at what cost?
