1
00:00:16,742 --> 00:00:17,663
<i>Danger looms!</i>

2
00:00:18,142 --> 00:00:20,343
<i>Despite recent victories
in the Outer Rim,</i>

3
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:23,223
<i>criminal minds plot
at the very heart of the Republic.</i>

4
00:00:23,503 --> 00:00:25,224
<i>The bounty hunter Cad Bane</i>

5
00:00:25,383 --> 00:00:27,824
<i>has assembled some of the deadliest
criminals in the galaxy</i>

6
00:00:28,104 --> 00:00:31,664
<i>and plans a daring attack
to seize members of the Senate.</i>

7
00:00:31,944 --> 00:00:34,080
<i>What could be the aim
of this despicable act?</i>

8
00:00:35,664 --> 00:00:36,664
Here we go.

9
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:41,424
<i>Attention, attention!
This is a restricted area.</i>

10
00:00:41,745 --> 00:00:44,065
<i>No landing is permitted
without permission.</i>

11
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:47,586
<i>Violators will be prosecuted
to the full extent of the law.</i>

12
00:00:50,026 --> 00:00:51,025
Put up your hands.

13
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,827
I've got business with the Senate.

14
00:00:55,226 --> 00:00:57,027
How about you fellas step aside?

15
00:00:57,187 --> 00:00:58,986
On your knees.
Raise your hands.

16
00:00:59,907 --> 00:01:00,867
Slowly.

17
00:01:01,547 --> 00:01:02,507
Son,

18
00:01:03,027 --> 00:01:05,707
I wouldn't be so hasty
if I were you.

19
00:01:06,188 --> 00:01:07,148
Cuff him.

20
00:01:11,468 --> 00:01:14,228
- Where's that coming from?
- I see the shooter up in the tower.

21
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:15,389
Over there!

22
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,350
You two, get these uniforms on
and get this platform clear.

23
00:01:45,592 --> 00:01:48,432
<i>Base to platform.
What was all that? Report.</i>

24
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:51,784
Protesters against the war.
We've taken care of them.

25
00:02:03,393 --> 00:02:06,834
Finish getting those uniforms on
and clear this platform, now.

26
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:08,274
Everybody else,

27
00:02:09,154 --> 00:02:10,114
follow me.

28
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:20,275
I'm supposed to be
on a meditative retreat.

29
00:02:20,395 --> 00:02:22,195
We should go away together.

30
00:02:22,315 --> 00:02:25,636
I know a place far away from here
where no one would recognise us.

31
00:02:25,756 --> 00:02:27,836
It would be like
we're actually husband and wife,

32
00:02:27,956 --> 00:02:30,356
instead of senator and Jedi.

33
00:02:31,557 --> 00:02:34,076
- I can't, Ani.
- What do you mean, you can't?

34
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,637
It's only two weeks.

35
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:37,997
We'll be back before anyone
even notices we're gone.

36
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:41,558
I have to bring this bill
before the Senate. It's important.

37
00:02:43,078 --> 00:02:45,878
More important
than the way you feel about me?

38
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:49,198
Not more important,
but important.

39
00:02:49,558 --> 00:02:52,239
The work I do...
The work we both do...

40
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:54,159
is in service to the Republic.

41
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:57,319
To protect those who would otherwise
be powerless to protect themselves.

42
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,479
Of course.
But those are ideals.

43
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,759
Isn't our love
more important to you?

44
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,959
- But I...
- No, no "but".

45
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:05,479
To me,

46
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,601
there's nothing more important
than the way I feel about you.

47
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,561
Nothing.

48
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:12,681
- Anakin, don't be so...
- You don't believe me.

49
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:14,520
- I didn't say...
- I'll prove it.

50
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:15,521
Just watch.

51
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,401
When I finished constructing
my lightsaber, Obi-Wan said to me,

52
00:03:19,521 --> 00:03:22,521
"Anakin, this weapon is your life. "

53
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:25,882
This weapon is my life.

54
00:03:26,002 --> 00:03:29,522
No, Anakin, I can't.
A Jedi lightsaber is...

55
00:03:32,802 --> 00:03:33,538
Wow.

56
00:03:33,643 --> 00:03:35,483
It's heavier than I thought.

57
00:03:36,003 --> 00:03:37,083
It's yours.

58
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:38,803
Believe me now?

59
00:03:39,884 --> 00:03:41,884
If all you want to do
is make fun of me,

60
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:44,364
- I think you should just go.
- That's not what I want.

61
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:46,244
Not at all.

62
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:02,726
Stop!

63
00:04:14,247 --> 00:04:15,688
You know what to do.

64
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:18,327
I'll figure it out.

65
00:04:18,727 --> 00:04:21,607
You better not fail me,
bubble brain.

66
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,608
Don't worry,
I'll have the power out in no time.

67
00:04:25,928 --> 00:04:27,808
The rest of you come with me.

68
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:34,089
But, Senator Organa,
it just wouldn't be...

69
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,249
Quick, hide!

70
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:38,170
Now stand aside.

71
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:40,689
I apologise for my abruptness.

72
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,570
Senator Organa,
how good to see you.

73
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:44,850
What is it?

74
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,450
Senator Filo has called
a meeting in the lobby

75
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,691
before we vote
on the Enhanced Privacy Invasion Bill.

76
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,771
Right,
Privacy Invasion Bill.

77
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,771
We must hurry
if we are to stop the vote.

78
00:04:56,891 --> 00:04:58,371
Coming, Senator Amidala?

79
00:04:58,931 --> 00:04:59,852
Of course.

80
00:05:11,693 --> 00:05:12,653
Quietly.

81
00:05:14,453 --> 00:05:17,333
Guard change happens... now.

82
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:23,014
Here we go.

83
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,296
Now let's go talk to some senators.

84
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:44,056
Help me.

85
00:05:45,576 --> 00:05:46,256
No!

86
00:05:48,937 --> 00:05:50,417
We cannot allow the chancellor

87
00:05:50,537 --> 00:05:53,297
to move this enhanced Privacy
Invasion Bill forward.

88
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:55,258
We are all in agreement then.

89
00:05:57,178 --> 00:05:58,778
Morning, Senators.

90
00:05:59,378 --> 00:06:02,738
You should all consider yourselves
to be in my power.

91
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:07,579
As long as everybody behaves
this will be quick and painless.

92
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:11,339
Do nothing,
and it will all be over soon.

93
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:14,219
I don't know
who you think you are

94
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:18,980
but I for one have no intention
of listening to this kind of insolence.

95
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,700
All right, then.

96
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:27,380
If you all gather at the center
of this lovely atrium,

97
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:32,341
my co-workers and I will relieve you
of any communication devices.

98
00:06:32,982 --> 00:06:35,221
I see five of them here in the room.
If we...

99
00:06:35,341 --> 00:06:38,622
What are you going to do?
It's not like we carry weapons.

100
00:06:42,422 --> 00:06:43,823
Chancellor Palpatine.

101
00:06:44,422 --> 00:06:46,303
What is it, Senator Free Taa?

102
00:06:47,063 --> 00:06:48,863
I think you should see this.

103
00:06:49,463 --> 00:06:51,143
<i>Sorry to bother you, Chancellor,</i>

104
00:06:51,463 --> 00:06:55,024
<i>but I've taken control of the east wing
of your Senate building,</i>

105
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:58,064
<i>and the occupants
are now my hostages.</i>

106
00:06:58,383 --> 00:06:59,864
<i>If you care about them,</i>

107
00:06:59,984 --> 00:07:03,784
<i>I'd advise you to free Ziro the Hutt
from the detention center.</i>

108
00:07:04,265 --> 00:07:07,705
You should know that the Republic
does not take kindly to such threats.

109
00:07:07,945 --> 00:07:11,705
If you have attempted such a fool-hardy
action as to kidnap a senator,

110
00:07:11,985 --> 00:07:15,186
I assure you that it will be met
with appropriate force.

111
00:07:16,105 --> 00:07:17,946
This ought to do it.

112
00:07:26,027 --> 00:07:27,027
What's going on?

113
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:28,667
<i>I'm in control.</i>

114
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,387
<i>I make the rules now.</i>

115
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:36,748
Orn Free Taa,
help me with this door.

116
00:07:37,347 --> 00:07:38,668
It's no use, sir.

117
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:41,508
Someone's gotten
to the central control panel.

118
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,989
They've triggered
the security system.

119
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:46,548
The Senate buildings
have sealed themselves.

120
00:07:47,628 --> 00:07:49,509
This is Chancellor Palpatine.

121
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,069
There is an emergency
at the Senate building.

122
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,150
Jedi Council, come in.

123
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,670
Is anyone there?

124
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,590
That's no use either, sir.

125
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,670
They've cut off all communication
with the outside.

126
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:07,671
Hand over your
communication devices, please.

127
00:08:14,152 --> 00:08:16,192
- I can't let them search me.
- What?

128
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:17,272
Why not?

129
00:08:17,472 --> 00:08:20,673
- I have something they must not find.
- What is it?

130
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:24,073
Well,
hello there, little lady.

131
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:26,193
And who might you be?

132
00:08:26,913 --> 00:08:28,313
I am Padme Amidala,

133
00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:29,714
Senator from Naboo.

134
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,874
And I demand
that you release us immediately.

135
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:34,114
The Galactic Senate
will not treat with terrorists.

136
00:08:34,634 --> 00:08:37,874
Ain't you awful young and pretty
to be a senator?

137
00:08:45,635 --> 00:08:47,836
Skywalker?!
After him!

138
00:08:54,156 --> 00:08:55,836
Hello, come in.
Anyone there?

139
00:09:01,237 --> 00:09:02,037
Uh-oh.

140
00:10:16,924 --> 00:10:19,084
This is General Skywalker.
Chancellor Palpatine,

141
00:10:19,205 --> 00:10:21,445
<i>- can you hear me?
- My dear boy,</i>

142
00:10:21,564 --> 00:10:23,645
I'm glad to know
you're there and all right.

143
00:10:23,725 --> 00:10:26,446
<i>- What is going on down there?
- I hear it too.</i>

144
00:10:26,565 --> 00:10:27,846
Coming from up ahead.

145
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:33,686
<i>They've sealed the entire building.
Nobody can get in</i>

146
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:34,967
<i>and we cannot get out.</i>

147
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:37,766
<i>It's up to you. You have to
get to the power control room</i>

148
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:40,086
<i>and turn off the security seal.</i>

149
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:54,768
You have two more floors to check.

150
00:10:55,648 --> 00:10:58,289
Come on.
We've got two more floors to check.

151
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,851
You take downstairs,
I'll go up.

152
00:11:19,131 --> 00:11:21,051
We'll meet on the other side.

153
00:12:22,098 --> 00:12:23,497
No lightsaber cuts?

154
00:12:26,618 --> 00:12:27,698
Interesting.

155
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:32,939
What happened?
Where's the droid?

156
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,658
The droid's gone,

157
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:36,299
but there's good news.

158
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:39,139
- The Jedi's unarmed.
- What?

159
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,060
It doesn't look like
he has his lightsaber.

160
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,300
Go, bring him back to me.

161
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:05,382
- The lightsaber, I've got it.
- What?

162
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:09,462
Why do you have a Jedi's lightsaber?

163
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:13,383
The question is whether we should
try and get it back to A...

164
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:15,823
...the Jedi knight
or use it ourselves.

165
00:13:18,023 --> 00:13:21,104
Everybody quiet.
I've got a call to make.

166
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:26,064
<i>So here's what you're going to do.</i>

167
00:13:26,384 --> 00:13:29,264
<i>First you're going to
make a pardon disc.</i>

168
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:32,824
<i>- You can give it to your friend there.
- Me?</i>

169
00:13:33,184 --> 00:13:36,025
<i>My ship will come and pick him up
and take him to the prison.</i>

170
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:40,426
<i>Once Ziro has been released
and is handed over to me,</i>

171
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,986
<i>then your associate will be released.
Understand?</i>

172
00:13:44,705 --> 00:13:45,665
Oh, I do.

173
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,106
But I feel it is my duty
to warn you

174
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:50,386
that you will end up
paying for this outrage.

175
00:13:51,026 --> 00:13:52,467
<i>I can live with that.</i>

176
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:54,707
Come on, open the door.

177
00:13:54,987 --> 00:13:56,307
I won't hurt you.

178
00:13:57,267 --> 00:14:00,227
Well, well,
what have we here?

179
00:14:06,148 --> 00:14:07,108
Blast it!

180
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:20,389
Tie your little pet up.
We'll bring him to Bane.

181
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,349
Here's the pardon disc.

182
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,110
Let's go.

183
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,871
Why do I have to
go to the jail for this?

184
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:33,071
- Move it.
- Sorry, Senator.

185
00:14:33,711 --> 00:14:35,831
But everyone has a job to do.

186
00:14:39,552 --> 00:14:40,512
Hurry up.

187
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:06,554
Young Skywalker.

188
00:15:07,714 --> 00:15:10,994
Not so impressive
without your lightsaber,

189
00:15:11,315 --> 00:15:13,515
are you, Jedi?

190
00:15:13,835 --> 00:15:15,755
Toss him in with the others.

191
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:28,036
3D, are we on schedule?

192
00:15:30,557 --> 00:15:32,557
Arriving at the prison now.

193
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:47,039
Unlock the doors.

194
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,320
- It's so bright out here!
- Oh, my God.

195
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:58,160
Why couldn't they do this at night
when it's cooler?

196
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,000
Go and get the parting gifts.

197
00:16:18,402 --> 00:16:20,962
Look at Senator Orn Free Taa.

198
00:16:21,122 --> 00:16:23,362
He looks so unhappy.

199
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:31,523
Now get me as far away
from Coruscant as possible!

200
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:32,963
Now!

201
00:16:33,843 --> 00:16:35,444
<i>Well, Mr. Chancellor,</i>

202
00:16:35,523 --> 00:16:39,124
<i>thanks to your calm leadership,
the crisis is passed.</i>

203
00:16:39,844 --> 00:16:41,124
<i>I got what I want,</i>

204
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:44,884
<i>so I'll return your Senate
and your senators.</i>

205
00:16:45,284 --> 00:16:46,405
<i>Enjoy them,</i>

206
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:49,764
<i>but don't try anything
until the sun has set.</i>

207
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:51,525
<i>Understand?</i>

208
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:57,205
We are to rendezvous
back at the Senate building.

209
00:16:57,605 --> 00:16:58,566
What?!

210
00:16:58,805 --> 00:17:00,326
No, no, no, no!

211
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:04,486
The Outer Rim, not the Senate,
you stupid machine!

212
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:11,607
We need to
get to the landing platform.

213
00:17:11,688 --> 00:17:13,687
- Is everything ready?
- Yep, yep.

214
00:17:14,008 --> 00:17:15,368
Turn on the field.

215
00:17:15,488 --> 00:17:18,408
If you so much as breathe
on one of these lasers,

216
00:17:18,488 --> 00:17:20,248
the whole room will blow up.

217
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:22,328
Senators, Jedi,

218
00:17:22,649 --> 00:17:25,929
I bid you all
the most respectful farewell.

219
00:17:26,489 --> 00:17:27,488
Let's go.

220
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,211
All clear!

221
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,171
- Sir, are you all right?
- Yes, yes, I'm fine.

222
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:49,531
Mission accomplished, sir.

223
00:17:49,731 --> 00:17:51,211
<i>The chancellor is safe.</i>

224
00:17:52,091 --> 00:17:53,532
Well done, trooper.

225
00:18:02,813 --> 00:18:06,653
<i>You were foolish to think you could
get away with this, bounty hunter.</i>

226
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:09,253
<i>Now lay down your arms
and come quietly.</i>

227
00:18:09,693 --> 00:18:11,053
No, Chancellor.

228
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:14,413
I am afraid it is you
who have been foolish

229
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,333
with your senators' lives.

230
00:18:16,974 --> 00:18:18,254
<i>One false move</i>

231
00:18:18,374 --> 00:18:21,694
<i>and the east wing of the Senate building
goes up in smoke.</i>

232
00:18:24,255 --> 00:18:26,334
Please, Ani, wake up.

233
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,655
You win, bounty hunter.

234
00:18:31,855 --> 00:18:32,815
Holster!

235
00:18:34,575 --> 00:18:35,616
Stand down.

236
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,217
What are you looking so sad about?

237
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:53,058
The bounty hunter said
we should just sit here.

238
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,298
I think we should just sit here.

239
00:18:55,378 --> 00:18:57,498
Well,
that's not a very good idea.

240
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:07,499
Come on.

241
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,100
Let's get going.

242
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,700
Too bad
I don't have my lightsaber.

243
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,781
You mean this?

244
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,620
I found it
where you dropped it.

245
00:19:27,141 --> 00:19:29,542
Now, quickly.
We don't have much time.

246
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:34,182
Well, Hutt,

247
00:19:34,902 --> 00:19:39,622
it doesn't look like prison had
too adverse an effect on you.

248
00:19:40,862 --> 00:19:45,543
You can't imagine
the unspeakable things I've suffered.

249
00:19:46,263 --> 00:19:47,863
The horror!

250
00:19:48,423 --> 00:19:51,263
I doubt I'll ever really recover.

251
00:19:51,584 --> 00:19:53,944
How about some dead senators
as payback?

252
00:20:09,026 --> 00:20:11,586
Another daring rescue,
Master Jedi.

253
00:20:12,105 --> 00:20:14,746
I do my best, Senator.

254
00:20:16,266 --> 00:20:20,746
Congratulations
on a job well done,

255
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:22,267
bounty hunter.

256
00:20:22,827 --> 00:20:25,227
Time to pay up, Hutt.

257
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,787
I don't work for free.
