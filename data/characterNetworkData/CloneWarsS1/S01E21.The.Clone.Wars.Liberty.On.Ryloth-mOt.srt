1
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:18,681
<i>Republic victory is at hand!</i>

2
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:21,320
<i>Clone troopers,
under the command of the Jedi,</i>

3
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:24,440
<i>have successfully invaded
the Separatist-occupied world of Ryloth.</i>

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,960
<i>Anakin Skywalker
battles the enemies in the skies,</i>

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,519
<i>while Obi-Wan Kenobi frees villages</i>

6
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:33,639
<i>from the grip of vile Separatist leader
Wat Tambor.</i>

7
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:37,958
<i>Now Jedi General Mace Windu
leads the attack on enemy lines</i>

8
00:00:38,118 --> 00:00:41,558
<i>in the final offensive to liberate
the capital city of Lessu.</i>

9
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,476
Take cover.

10
00:01:05,876 --> 00:01:08,914
- We have stopped the enemy advance.
- Give me those.

11
00:01:10,434 --> 00:01:11,315
Good.

12
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:14,034
Now order our cannon
to target their rear units.

13
00:01:14,515 --> 00:01:17,114
We'll box them in
and blast them to pieces.

14
00:01:23,393 --> 00:01:24,353
We're pinned down!

15
00:01:24,513 --> 00:01:26,433
Commander,
bring out the Lightning squad.

16
00:01:27,152 --> 00:01:28,672
I want Lightning up here now!

17
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:43,070
Get the injured back.
I'm gonna clear the road.

18
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,229
- Sir, the enemy is advancing again.
- Let me see.

19
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:02,349
Find some cover.
Move it! Let's go!

20
00:02:06,188 --> 00:02:07,788
He's all yours, General.

21
00:02:08,748 --> 00:02:10,627
We'll lead the way, Commander.

22
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:13,947
Forward!

23
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:25,573
Now that Jedi is leading the attack.

24
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:27,875
This doesn't look good.

25
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:30,402
Concentrate all your fire
on those walkers!

26
00:02:34,718 --> 00:02:35,581
Did we hit 'em?

27
00:02:45,705 --> 00:02:46,673
Should we run?

28
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:52,304
It would be better
if we just surrendered.

29
00:03:08,782 --> 00:03:10,462
How many men did we lose?

30
00:03:10,942 --> 00:03:13,901
32, I think,
including command crews of 3 walkers.

31
00:03:14,702 --> 00:03:17,101
The good news is,
General Kenobi's broken their lines.

32
00:03:17,181 --> 00:03:19,741
We have a clear path
straight to the capital now.

33
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,300
<i>This battle was costly.</i>

34
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,980
<i>We're going to need help
to take the city.</i>

35
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,340
The Republic is advancing faster
than I expected.

36
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,299
I calculate they will reach
the main gates by morning.

37
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,819
- I recommend we prepare our retreat.
- I will not retreat.

38
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:39,418
That Jedi does not have the troops
to take this city.

39
00:03:39,738 --> 00:03:43,098
Bring our units inside the walls
and secure the bridge.

40
00:03:47,097 --> 00:03:48,777
<i>What's your progress, Skywalker?</i>

41
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:52,137
<i>My fighters have secured control
of the space around Ryloth.</i>

42
00:03:52,296 --> 00:03:54,216
<i>We have the Separatist cruisers
on the run.</i>

43
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:56,216
<i>Very good, General Skywalker.</i>

44
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:58,856
Master Kenobi has taken
the Jixuan desert,

45
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:01,016
so the southern hemisphere is ours.

46
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:03,735
<i>Then it's almost over.</i>

47
00:04:03,975 --> 00:04:06,695
Not yet. The key position
is the capital of Lessu.

48
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:07,855
Our spies are certain

49
00:04:07,975 --> 00:04:10,694
the Separatist leader Wat Tambor
has his command center there.

50
00:04:11,094 --> 00:04:14,614
<i>When taken the city we have,
capture Tambor we must.</i>

51
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,374
It's not going to be easy, Master.

52
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:18,854
Tambor has chosen
his stronghold well.

53
00:04:19,014 --> 00:04:21,653
This plasma bridge
is the only way in or out.

54
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:25,333
<i>I'm afraid a siege
could drag on indefinitely.</i>

55
00:04:25,573 --> 00:04:27,572
<i>My people have suffered so much
already.</i>

56
00:04:27,972 --> 00:04:30,852
<i>A plan you have, to take the bridge,
Master Windu?</i>

57
00:04:31,252 --> 00:04:33,172
With our forces stretched so thinly,

58
00:04:33,252 --> 00:04:37,092
I'm gonna enlist the help of the freedom
fighters led by Cham Syndulla.

59
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:40,451
His fight against the droids has made him
a symbol of freedom for the people.

60
00:04:40,611 --> 00:04:41,891
<i>Cham Syndulla...</i>

61
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:44,451
<i>...was a radical before the war.</i>

62
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:46,691
<i>He is very unpredictable.</i>

63
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,371
<i>He can't be trusted.</i>

64
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:51,090
<i>I know
Syndulla seeks to gain power.</i>

65
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,010
<i>We were political rivals.</i>

66
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,449
I'll leave the politics to you,
Senator.

67
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,889
I'm gonna do whatever I can
to help these people.

68
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:01,712
<i>Perhaps we could send you
Republic reinforcements instead.</i>

69
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:05,168
<i>There are no reinforcements available,
Chancellor.</i>

70
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:07,808
We can't win without Syndulla's help.

71
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:18,927
What makes you think
the rebels are this way, General?

72
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:21,967
What is it, sir?

73
00:05:22,846 --> 00:05:25,806
The resistance fighters
ride creatures native to this region.

74
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:27,406
And these tracks are fresh.

75
00:05:31,245 --> 00:05:33,197
Which means they can't be that far.

76
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:37,605
Isn't this the spot
where they were massacred?

77
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:39,805
Looks like
it was a hell of a fight.

78
00:05:40,724 --> 00:05:43,004
Wonder who put up these gravestones.

79
00:05:43,803 --> 00:05:44,923
Is that them?

80
00:05:59,242 --> 00:06:01,722
<i>Your tactical droid has informed me</i>

81
00:06:01,882 --> 00:06:05,722
<i>of the pitiful job you have done
protecting our investment on Ryloth.</i>

82
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:08,601
That droid exaggerates.

83
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,761
I have not lost yet.

84
00:06:11,161 --> 00:06:13,480
<i>You're no match for Master Windu.</i>

85
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,200
<i>Do not become greedy,
Emir Tambor.</i>

86
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,039
<i>Take what valuables you can
and destroy everything else.</i>

87
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,480
Everything?

88
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,759
<i>We can put this defeat
to political use.</i>

89
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:28,759
<i>The charred ruins of Ryloth
will demonstrate to the galaxy</i>

90
00:06:29,078 --> 00:06:32,118
<i>the cost of a Republic victory.</i>

91
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:33,717
As you wish.

92
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,999
Keep on the lookout
for that lost patrol.

93
00:06:48,998 --> 00:06:50,359
Did you hear that?

94
00:07:01,283 --> 00:07:02,706
I don't see anything.

95
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:05,583
Look, it's RB-551.

96
00:07:06,064 --> 00:07:07,694
No wonder he got blasted.

97
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:11,051
He's one of those older models
programmed by a central computer.

98
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:13,450
Not us.
We're independent thinkers.

99
00:07:13,546 --> 00:07:15,560
- Roger, roger.
- Roger, roger.

100
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,889
Why didn't we take them out, sir?

101
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,489
I have a feeling
the rebels will do it for us.

102
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,729
- Look out! It's an ambush!
- Help!

103
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:33,329
It's the resistance!

104
00:07:53,726 --> 00:07:56,606
I was wondering when you'd find me,
Master Jedi.

105
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:58,206
General Syndulla,

106
00:07:59,086 --> 00:08:02,685
- I've come for your help.
- What makes you think you'll get it?

107
00:08:08,084 --> 00:08:11,324
Emir Tambor, our bombers
are nearly ready for launch.

108
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:19,283
And now I will ready your ship
for evacuation.

109
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,354
No!
I am not yet ready to leave.

110
00:08:22,842 --> 00:08:26,322
In any case, we have a schedule to keep.
The ship will be ready.

111
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,040
- Some hideout you have here.
- It has advantages.

112
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,239
We saw the graves

113
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:56,439
of many of your people
in that battlefield as well.

114
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,399
Together, we can prevent that
from happening again.

115
00:08:59,518 --> 00:09:02,078
Do you know why we were massacred,
Master Jedi?

116
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:04,038
When the droids swept over Ryloth,

117
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:06,317
the Republic was unable to help us.

118
00:09:06,438 --> 00:09:09,557
We were forced to surrender,
and we came here unarmed.

119
00:09:10,077 --> 00:09:12,917
The Separatists brought tanks
to exterminate us.

120
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:15,157
Come here, boy.

121
00:09:15,357 --> 00:09:16,557
Come on. Don't be afraid.

122
00:09:17,117 --> 00:09:18,956
See, there's nothing
to be afraid of here.

123
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,196
He says his blurrg
may be ill-tempered,

124
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:27,515
but she's much faster
than your riding machines.

125
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:29,914
I don't know about that.

126
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:42,673
What is this, a scratch?

127
00:09:44,473 --> 00:09:46,873
Gobi, get better.
I need you.

128
00:09:49,593 --> 00:09:51,232
We have little food or drink,

129
00:09:51,352 --> 00:09:54,672
but it is our tradition to share
what we do have with our guests.

130
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:09,500
Target every Twi'lek village
in range,

131
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:12,499
- the inhabited ones first.
- Of course.

132
00:10:25,378 --> 00:10:27,458
Our scouts reported in
from the village up ahead.

133
00:10:27,578 --> 00:10:29,017
The enemy's already pulled out, sir.

134
00:10:29,098 --> 00:10:31,417
Friendlies are all that's left,
mostly women and children.

135
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:34,216
See if we can spare some rations.
They'll be hungry.

136
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:37,057
Sir, enemy ships
are entering our sector.

137
00:10:43,336 --> 00:10:45,696
- Damage report!
- There's no tactical damage, sir.

138
00:10:45,815 --> 00:10:48,055
It didn't hit us.
They bombed the village.

139
00:10:56,974 --> 00:10:58,686
Make contact with General Windu.

140
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:08,733
I hope you don't mind this.

141
00:11:09,652 --> 00:11:13,492
A little distraction goes far
to ease the burden of the war on my men.

142
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:17,052
You have provided well for your men,
all your people.

143
00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:19,931
So why won't you help me
free them from this occupation?

144
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:24,251
I don't trust Senator Taa. His plans
for our world after the war...

145
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:26,851
The Republic will help you rebuild.

146
00:11:26,971 --> 00:11:30,330
- We won't abandon you.
- Your troops will stay for security?

147
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,090
For a while, to keep the peace.

148
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:36,249
Another armed occupation
is not a free Ryloth.

149
00:11:36,969 --> 00:11:39,769
How long before I am fighting you,
Master Jedi?

150
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:44,728
What is it, Commander?

151
00:11:44,888 --> 00:11:46,808
<i>The droids have begun
a firebombing campaign.</i>

152
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:49,248
<i>Several villages in our sector
have been destroyed, sir.</i>

153
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,446
Make the arrangements.

154
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:03,207
I will speak to Senator Taa.

155
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:09,886
Is this all of it?

156
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:13,765
We are still awaiting two transports
from our southern base.

157
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:16,205
- Should we depart without them?
- No.

158
00:12:16,325 --> 00:12:19,484
I will have every valuable on this rock
before I leave.

159
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:22,508
<i>Emir Tambor,
why haven't you evacuated?</i>

160
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:26,828
Our exit strategy
is taking more time to implement.

161
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:30,987
<i>I want you out of the city
before the Republic arrives.</i>

162
00:12:31,387 --> 00:12:33,907
<i>Once Master Windu
has invaded the capital,</i>

163
00:12:34,227 --> 00:12:36,027
<i>you will bomb it from afar.</i>

164
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:38,786
<i>- Am I understood?
- Yes, Count Dooku.</i>

165
00:12:40,346 --> 00:12:43,185
You will not do anything
until I give the order.

166
00:12:43,865 --> 00:12:45,545
We have our orders, Emir.

167
00:12:51,864 --> 00:12:52,905
Senator Taa,

168
00:12:53,184 --> 00:12:56,264
so glad you could join us
from comfortable Coruscant.

169
00:12:56,544 --> 00:12:58,904
Our people have survived
with only me.

170
00:12:59,383 --> 00:13:02,943
<i>I knew you would try to turn this
into a campaign to take power.</i>

171
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:05,423
<i>Need I remind you
that it is I...</i>

172
00:13:06,103 --> 00:13:07,903
<i>who leads our people in the Senate?</i>

173
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:11,263
And it is I who leads our people
here and now.

174
00:13:11,902 --> 00:13:15,062
There will be nothing left to lead
if you two refuse to work together.

175
00:13:15,182 --> 00:13:18,181
<i>- General Windu, do you copy?
- I hear you, Skywalker.</i>

176
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:20,462
My fighters are
taking out the bombers

177
00:13:20,581 --> 00:13:22,901
as fast as they can, Master Windu,
but there are just too many.

178
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:24,781
<i>I doubt we can stop them all.</i>

179
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,220
<i>I suggest you get the people
away from the cities.</i>

180
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,580
You must destroy those bombers,
Skywalker.

181
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,740
<i>- Then meet me at the capital.
- I'll do what I can.</i>

182
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:41,058
<i>What can the Separatists
hope to gain</i>

183
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:42,858
<i>from burning our homes?</i>

184
00:13:43,138 --> 00:13:44,098
Nothing.

185
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:47,378
Wat Tambor spoils for others
what he cannot possess.

186
00:13:47,858 --> 00:13:49,378
<i>Then we must act quickly.</i>

187
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:52,057
Senator,
your people are hesitant to join us

188
00:13:52,177 --> 00:13:54,857
because they're worried there'll be
another military occupation.

189
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,656
<i>The people have my promise</i>

190
00:13:58,377 --> 00:14:00,296
<i>that the clone army will leave</i>

191
00:14:00,657 --> 00:14:03,616
<i>once Ryloth is free of those droids.</i>

192
00:14:04,768 --> 00:14:05,631
General,

193
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,855
what assurance can you give Senator Taa
you will not try to assume power?

194
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:13,135
I only want to see my people free,
Master Jedi.

195
00:14:13,575 --> 00:14:14,775
I give my word.

196
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:16,734
I believe in democracy.

197
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:20,694
Then we are together in this.

198
00:14:25,054 --> 00:14:26,213
Men of Ryloth,

199
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:28,373
the time has come

200
00:14:29,093 --> 00:14:30,653
to free ourselves!

201
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:40,435
They're deactivating the bridge.

202
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,354
Let's move!

203
00:14:43,122 --> 00:14:44,656
Get off the bridge!

204
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,370
- Deactivate the bridge.
- Roger, roger.

205
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:53,768
What the...?

206
00:14:56,742 --> 00:14:58,660
What about the city inhabitants?

207
00:14:58,756 --> 00:15:01,729
Drive them outside,
but not too far.

208
00:15:01,826 --> 00:15:06,045
The Jedi will reconsider an attack
when he sees them in his line of fire.

209
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,381
Keep moving.

210
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,180
Try and keep up, clone.

211
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:43,459
Tambor is still there.

212
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,818
How are we going to attack
with my people so close?

213
00:15:47,338 --> 00:15:48,697
Your people will never be in danger

214
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:51,337
if our walkers can cross the bridge
into the city.

215
00:15:51,457 --> 00:15:53,617
The key is
getting control of that bridge.

216
00:15:55,377 --> 00:15:57,097
Perhaps there is your way.

217
00:16:00,896 --> 00:16:03,552
My spies tell me
those transports carry treasure.

218
00:16:04,032 --> 00:16:07,101
It's not enough for the Separatists
to enslave and murder us.

219
00:16:07,294 --> 00:16:08,732
They must rob us, too.

220
00:16:08,938 --> 00:16:11,058
You think we can use them
to get across the bridge?

221
00:16:11,362 --> 00:16:14,442
It is risky.
They are usually scanned while crossing.

222
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:27,760
When I get control of the bridge,
you must start the attack.

223
00:16:40,118 --> 00:16:41,479
They're in. Let's go.

224
00:16:50,157 --> 00:16:52,517
Commander,
I'll need you to create a diversion.

225
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:54,836
<i>Get the rest
of Lightning squadron ready.</i>

226
00:16:54,956 --> 00:16:55,916
Yes, sir.

227
00:16:56,756 --> 00:16:58,036
My men are ready.

228
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:04,076
It is time to leave.

229
00:17:04,196 --> 00:17:06,915
The Republic walkers
are holding at 1,200 meters.

230
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:10,675
Sir, the last shipments of treasure
are approaching.

231
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,195
Just in time.

232
00:17:12,634 --> 00:17:15,434
Activate the bridge
and get them across immediately.

233
00:17:16,274 --> 00:17:18,154
Initiating plasma projectors.

234
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,990
All right, hold it there.

235
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,269
Let's go.
The boss wants this done.

236
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,589
This one's all clear.

237
00:18:04,989 --> 00:18:05,988
Here they come.

238
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:10,892
Wait!
I'm picking up an anomaly in there.

239
00:18:11,531 --> 00:18:12,532
Stay alert.

240
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:20,530
Trooper, prepare to fire.

241
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:23,065
Open the cargo hatch.

242
00:18:26,544 --> 00:18:29,385
- Oh, no!
- You're under arrest. You have the ri...

243
00:18:30,216 --> 00:18:31,424
We're under attack!

244
00:18:36,696 --> 00:18:37,975
Deactivate the bridge!

245
00:18:38,655 --> 00:18:40,414
Oh, well.
Too bad for them.

246
00:18:41,223 --> 00:18:43,342
Run for it!
They're turning the bridge off!

247
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:13,819
I'll hold them off.
Get that bridge back up.

248
00:19:13,923 --> 00:19:15,018
Sir, yes, sir!

249
00:19:15,898 --> 00:19:16,858
Charge!

250
00:19:44,662 --> 00:19:46,580
Hey!
You're not authorized.

251
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:47,749
Save it.

252
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,468
Bridge is up, sir.

253
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,385
You take these droids.
I'll go find Wat Tambor.

254
00:20:45,992 --> 00:20:47,527
Start my ship.

255
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:50,309
Wat Tambor is a fool.

256
00:20:58,459 --> 00:20:59,300
My ship!

257
00:21:04,283 --> 00:21:07,930
I'm afraid Emir Tambor refused
to retreat in time.

258
00:21:08,186 --> 00:21:10,402
<i>That is... unfortunate.</i>

259
00:21:11,202 --> 00:21:14,002
<i>Order our bombers
to destroy the capital immediately.</i>

260
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,120
Surrender.

261
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,000
General Windu,
perhaps we can come to a compromise.

262
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,479
Not when I hold all the cards.

263
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:35,639
It appears
a surrender is unnecessary.

264
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:39,239
We will all perish for the glory
of the Separatist alliance.

265
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:51,140
- That was close, Master.
- Isn't it always, Snips?

266
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,500
What are your terms for surrender?

267
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,699
They're unconditional.

268
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,379
Agreed.

269
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:04,099
I thank you, Master Jedi.

270
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:06,738
Today,
all of Ryloth thanks you.

271
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:10,658
You've earned your freedom, General,
all of you.
