1
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:18,677
<i>Viceroy Gunray captured!</i>

2
00:00:18,837 --> 00:00:21,397
<i>Senator Padme Amidala
has scored a victory</i>

3
00:00:21,476 --> 00:00:24,597
<i>against the Separatist alliance
on the remote world of Rodia,</i>

4
00:00:24,756 --> 00:00:27,717
<i>securing the arrest
of diabolical confederate leader</i>

5
00:00:27,877 --> 00:00:29,237
<i>Nute Gunray.</i>

6
00:00:29,316 --> 00:00:32,356
<i>The Jedi council has dispatched
Master Luminara Unduli</i>

7
00:00:32,436 --> 00:00:34,916
<i>and Anakin Skywalker's
padawan Ahsoka</i>

8
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:38,276
<i>to escort the viceroy
to Coruscant under heavy guard.</i>

9
00:00:38,356 --> 00:00:41,475
<i>Once there, he will face trial
for his many war crimes.</i>

10
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:48,276
Captain, have you made contact
with the cruiser?

11
00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:50,835
Yes, General.
We'll patch you through now.

12
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:52,915
Jedi cruiser Tranquility,

13
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:56,595
this is General Luminara Unduli
requesting permission to land.

14
00:00:56,755 --> 00:00:57,875
<i>You are clear, General.</i>

15
00:00:57,955 --> 00:01:01,235
<i>- We await your prisoner's arrival.
- Thank you, Captain Argyus.</i>

16
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,315
I look forward to
delivering him to you.

17
00:01:03,635 --> 00:01:05,555
I am a man of great wealth,

18
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:09,074
and I can be very generous
to my allies.

19
00:01:09,314 --> 00:01:12,595
That is a very tempting offer,
Viceroy.

20
00:01:12,754 --> 00:01:14,915
In the meantime,
I have a gift for you.

21
00:01:16,474 --> 00:01:19,154
Finally.
It's been such a boring trip.

22
00:01:33,314 --> 00:01:36,194
This is an outrageous
miscarriage of justice.

23
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:39,474
- I demand my litigator.
- Keep moving.

24
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:44,993
Greetings, General. We have the brig
all ready for this traitor.

25
00:01:45,153 --> 00:01:48,353
Very good, Captain.
Commander Gree, let's get under way.

26
00:01:48,513 --> 00:01:50,273
Right away, sir.
Let's move!

27
00:01:57,232 --> 00:01:58,513
Senate commandos?

28
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:02,192
How does a money-grubbing worm
like Gunray rate all this security?

29
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:03,712
He doesn't look that dangerous.

30
00:02:03,952 --> 00:02:07,712
Don't let your overconfidence
give Gunray another advantage, Ahsoka.

31
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:08,752
Even now,

32
00:02:08,912 --> 00:02:11,472
his allies may be conspiring
against us.

33
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:22,191
<i>Gunray's capture</i>

34
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,911
<i>could be a serious threat to us,
my friend.</i>

35
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:28,951
<i>The viceroy will not last long
under Jedi interrogation.</i>

36
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:32,271
I have already put a plan
into action, My Lord.

37
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:35,470
My best agent, Asajj Ventress,

38
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:37,631
will infiltrate the Jedi ship

39
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,830
and either free Gunray
or silence him.

40
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:42,271
<i>Ventress?</i>

41
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:44,990
<i>You are putting
a great deal of faith</i>

42
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,350
<i>in an operative
who has failed us in the past.</i>

43
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,190
She is a gifted assassin.

44
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,631
You have my word...

45
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,990
she will complete
her mission to the letter.

46
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,110
<i>Very well.</i>

47
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,270
<i>You may proceed.</i>

48
00:03:04,029 --> 00:03:04,989
Master.

49
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,190
There is no margin for error
this time, child.

50
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,270
You must prove yourself

51
00:03:10,429 --> 00:03:13,469
worthy of being my apprentice.

52
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:15,309
I am worthy,

53
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:16,989
as you shall see.

54
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:33,709
How goes the interrogation?

55
00:03:33,788 --> 00:03:36,028
- Has the viceroy cracked?
- Not yet.

56
00:03:36,428 --> 00:03:40,268
Neimoidians are a slippery lot,
but the Jedi will wear him down.

57
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:43,948
Your thoughts betray you, Viceroy.

58
00:03:44,668 --> 00:03:46,348
I can sense your concern,

59
00:03:46,988 --> 00:03:49,387
the fear that you will lose
the wealth

60
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:51,707
and the power
that the war has given you.

61
00:03:51,788 --> 00:03:54,587
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

62
00:03:54,907 --> 00:03:56,748
You hide a great many things.

63
00:03:56,908 --> 00:03:58,828
The names of your secret allies,

64
00:03:59,227 --> 00:04:01,787
the locations of their bases.

65
00:04:01,947 --> 00:04:04,667
I am an innocent pawn
in all of this.

66
00:04:05,307 --> 00:04:08,507
If you're merely a pawn,
then who are you protecting?

67
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:09,627
No one.

68
00:04:09,787 --> 00:04:11,626
I know nothing.

69
00:04:12,107 --> 00:04:13,546
Liar! Liar!

70
00:04:13,706 --> 00:04:15,387
I'm tired of all this whining.

71
00:04:16,107 --> 00:04:18,106
Tell us what we want to know
right now,

72
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:22,026
or I will gut you
like a Rokarian dirt fish.

73
00:04:26,026 --> 00:04:27,106
Padawan!

74
00:04:27,386 --> 00:04:30,265
Terror is not a weapon the Jedi use.

75
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:31,866
I wasn't serious.

76
00:04:32,026 --> 00:04:34,545
But the only way he'll talk
is if he's scared enough.

77
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:38,265
Perhaps I was too hasty.

78
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:39,865
Let us negotiate.

79
00:04:44,665 --> 00:04:45,865
Captain, status report.

80
00:04:47,865 --> 00:04:50,185
Droid fighters incoming.
They've brought boarding ships.

81
00:05:00,904 --> 00:05:03,145
Green company,
prepare to repel the enemy.

82
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:50,502
Green leader to Commander Gree.

83
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:53,302
<i>Super battle droids
have breached our hull.</i>

84
00:05:59,782 --> 00:06:01,382
They're headed
for the detention level.

85
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:03,062
We need reinforcements.

86
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:07,462
- Commander, I'll need your assistance.
- Let's go.

87
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:10,981
You will stay here
with Captain Argyus.

88
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:12,822
- Guard the viceroy.
- But...

89
00:06:14,182 --> 00:06:15,621
As you wish, Master.

90
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:19,941
It appears you are in no position

91
00:06:20,021 --> 00:06:22,181
to negotiate after all, Padawan.

92
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:25,301
- Perhaps after my rescue...
- Rescue?

93
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:27,940
Maybe they're here
to make sure you won't talk.

94
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,300
All units, there's a bo...

95
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:51,699
<i>Trooper, what have you found?</i>

96
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,780
<i>Come in, trooper.
Do you copy?</i>

97
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:58,419
<i>Super battle droids are everywhere.</i>

98
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:02,259
<i>Fall back to the detention level.
We have to protect the prisoner.</i>

99
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:53,017
See anything?

100
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,417
Engine room seems clear.

101
00:07:58,537 --> 00:08:00,497
<i>- We'll lock it down.
- Good, Captain.</i>

102
00:08:00,617 --> 00:08:02,456
<i>The enemy's advancing
toward the prison level.</i>

103
00:08:02,576 --> 00:08:05,417
- We're on our way.
- You keep watch here, 327.

104
00:08:07,497 --> 00:08:09,096
Okay, 327-T.

105
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:13,016
You know droids never like
to be called by their nicknames.

106
00:08:56,055 --> 00:08:57,975
There. Looks like
the last of them, General.

107
00:08:58,214 --> 00:08:59,374
Yes, Commander,

108
00:08:59,615 --> 00:09:01,974
but I sense our troubles
are not over.

109
00:09:04,414 --> 00:09:07,294
Sounds like your rescue
didn't work out after all.

110
00:09:07,894 --> 00:09:10,733
I am ready to discuss
our bargain again.

111
00:09:11,094 --> 00:09:13,334
Padawan Tano,
may I have a word?

112
00:09:13,893 --> 00:09:15,013
Certainly, Captain.

113
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:17,613
If I leave,
you won't go anywhere, will you?

114
00:09:19,573 --> 00:09:20,933
I've got the all-clear.

115
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,813
The enemy has been repelled.

116
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:25,733
And their attempt
to free Gunray has... failed?

117
00:09:33,932 --> 00:09:36,692
If it isn't the hairless harpy.

118
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:41,772
If it isn't Skywalker's filthy,
obnoxious little pet.

119
00:09:42,492 --> 00:09:44,172
How nice of you.

120
00:09:44,572 --> 00:09:47,812
Tell you what,
I'll give you a merciful death.

121
00:09:52,052 --> 00:09:53,292
The padawan.

122
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:54,771
Come on.

123
00:10:03,532 --> 00:10:04,332
Shoot her!

124
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:16,371
Skywalker's not here
to save you now.

125
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:18,811
Good thing I don't need saving.

126
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:23,850
Over here!

127
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,610
Open this door,
and I'll buy you a planet.

128
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,650
Yes!

129
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,930
Yes, such delicious irony.

130
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:46,850
How do you like your room now,
youngling?

131
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:55,289
Halt, assassin!

132
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:03,648
Surrender.

133
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:41,047
What are we waiting for?

134
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:42,167
Ahsoka!

135
00:11:44,407 --> 00:11:45,167
Thanks.

136
00:11:45,327 --> 00:11:48,206
Everything's running haywire.
Doors, lifts...

137
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:50,686
Communication's down.
Propulsion's dead.

138
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,726
She's crippled the entire ship.

139
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:54,887
Our attacker has come for Gunray.

140
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,606
Stay here and guard him.

141
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:58,447
I'll confront her myself.

142
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:02,727
Master, all due respect,
but Ventress is too powerful

143
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:06,206
for any one Jedi to fight alone.
Let me help you.

144
00:12:06,366 --> 00:12:09,646
I am more than capable
of dealing with a lone assassin

145
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:12,166
armed with
undisciplined fighting skills.

146
00:12:12,326 --> 00:12:15,446
- But...
- Stay here and keep a clear head.

147
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,845
Luminara Unduli
may be a Jedi master,

148
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:32,725
but she has no idea
what that bog witch is capable of.

149
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,004
No idea!

150
00:12:46,484 --> 00:12:49,324
I can't let her
face that lowlife alone.

151
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,364
Wouldn't we have a better chance
of stopping her if I helped?

152
00:12:52,724 --> 00:12:56,484
Sometimes being a good soldier
means doing what you think is right.

153
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,804
That's why we're superior to droids.

154
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:07,283
Do you think you'll still be
able to call on the Force

155
00:13:07,403 --> 00:13:10,803
after I've separated your head
from your body?

156
00:13:10,963 --> 00:13:13,123
Even with my vision clouded,

157
00:13:13,723 --> 00:13:16,963
I recognize the fighting style
of Count Dooku.

158
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,243
Your version is unrefined,

159
00:13:19,843 --> 00:13:21,762
amateurish,
sloppy.

160
00:13:27,962 --> 00:13:30,842
I can't disobey a direct order
and leave my post,

161
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:33,122
- can I?
- I wouldn't.

162
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:34,402
Don't worry.

163
00:13:34,562 --> 00:13:36,482
We've got this under control,
Master Jedi.

164
00:13:36,802 --> 00:13:38,842
Your friend won't be going anywhere.

165
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:40,922
All I know is,

166
00:13:41,042 --> 00:13:44,641
I never risk my own skin
if I don't have to.

167
00:13:45,962 --> 00:13:46,762
What?

168
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:49,922
- Watch him closely.
- You can trust us, Commander.

169
00:13:51,602 --> 00:13:53,161
Call us if you need help, sir.

170
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,520
Now you fall...

171
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,079
as all Jedi must.

172
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:44,839
I know, I know.
You told me to stay.

173
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,559
Well, as long as you're here...

174
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,558
We have to find her.

175
00:15:00,678 --> 00:15:02,639
We can't let her get to Gunray.

176
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:17,278
What's that, Captain?

177
00:15:17,397 --> 00:15:18,998
Nothing to worry about.

178
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:22,398
What are you doing?

179
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:28,957
No, please don't.

180
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,557
Do shut up.

181
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:35,437
Count Dooku is paying me a fortune
to deliver your slimy carcass.

182
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:37,437
So please, try to stay alive.

183
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,555
- Ahsoka?
- What happened to "Padawan Tano"?

184
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:05,876
This assassin...

185
00:16:06,276 --> 00:16:08,715
I've never faced
an adversary like her.

186
00:16:09,475 --> 00:16:11,155
I should have listened
to your advice.

187
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:14,475
Master, I never meant to
overstep my bounds, but...

188
00:16:14,595 --> 00:16:16,395
<i>General Unduli,
we've been betrayed.</i>

189
00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:17,795
<i>Argyus has freed Gunray.</i>

190
00:16:19,075 --> 00:16:20,355
I've been a fool.

191
00:16:20,755 --> 00:16:22,315
Let's get back there.

192
00:16:32,874 --> 00:16:34,514
We'll take her together.

193
00:16:43,353 --> 00:16:45,034
Stop!
This is your last warning.

194
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:47,594
Don't shoot.
I am an innocent pawn.

195
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,034
He won't shoot.

196
00:16:49,314 --> 00:16:51,193
He doesn't want to damage his prize.

197
00:16:56,153 --> 00:16:58,473
- Stand down, Captain.
- Come and get me.

198
00:17:19,912 --> 00:17:21,552
Why'd you do it, Argyus?

199
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:25,192
A clone like you
would never understand.

200
00:17:25,472 --> 00:17:28,552
I wanted a life with more
than empty servitude.

201
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:31,472
And for that,
you'd betray the Republic?

202
00:17:31,672 --> 00:17:33,312
Like I told the padawan,

203
00:17:33,431 --> 00:17:35,272
sometimes being a good soldier

204
00:17:35,432 --> 00:17:37,271
means doing what you think is right.

205
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:46,071
You and I disagree
on what makes a good sold...

206
00:17:48,431 --> 00:17:51,711
You should have taken my offer
when you had the chance,

207
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,030
clone.

208
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:23,789
The outer shields are still down.

209
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:26,829
The ship is still in turmoil.
We're home free.

210
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:06,108
As successful a rescue
as one could hope for, Viceroy.

211
00:19:06,788 --> 00:19:08,548
I will be a legend for this.

212
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,748
I always had a good feeling
about you, Captain.

213
00:19:14,628 --> 00:19:16,147
You see, assassin?

214
00:19:16,548 --> 00:19:18,307
Our plan went off without a hitch.

215
00:19:18,468 --> 00:19:19,667
Our plan?

216
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:22,107
And I will, of course,

217
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,307
make sure your contributions
are noted

218
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:26,187
in my report to Count Dooku.

219
00:19:29,746 --> 00:19:31,227
I'll tell him myself.

220
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,826
Greetings, Viceroy.

221
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:39,506
I always had a good feeling
about you, assassin.

222
00:19:44,106 --> 00:19:47,746
I'm sorry that despicable
wealth-worm Gunray got away.

223
00:19:47,906 --> 00:19:49,186
<i>It's okay, Snips.</i>

224
00:19:49,506 --> 00:19:51,106
<i>I know you did your best.</i>

225
00:19:51,386 --> 00:19:52,466
Master, I...

226
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:55,466
<i>Troubling, is the treachery
of the Senate guard...</i>

227
00:19:55,586 --> 00:19:56,826
<i>Captain Argyus.</i>

228
00:19:56,945 --> 00:20:00,306
<i>Revealed all around us,
our enemies are.</i>

229
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:02,705
I'm not sure all is lost.

230
00:20:03,105 --> 00:20:06,705
Gunray and his accomplices stole
a Republic ship to make their getaway.

231
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:07,945
<i>It could be tracked.</i>

232
00:20:08,065 --> 00:20:10,464
<i>- Indeed.
- A coward, Viceroy Gunray is,</i>

233
00:20:11,105 --> 00:20:13,064
<i>but powerful allies, he has.</i>

234
00:20:13,425 --> 00:20:16,264
<i>Swiftly, we must move,
if we are to recapture him.</i>

235
00:20:16,688 --> 00:20:19,625
Master Fisto's fleet
was near Gunray's position.

236
00:20:20,025 --> 00:20:22,144
I've already contacted him
to follow the signal.

237
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,184
<i>Ahsoka, I'll meet you
at the rendezvous point.</i>

238
00:20:24,384 --> 00:20:25,304
Yes, Master.

239
00:20:27,744 --> 00:20:28,944
Master Luminara,

240
00:20:29,264 --> 00:20:30,744
I guess this is good-bye for now.

241
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,984
I owe you my life, Ahsoka.

242
00:20:34,704 --> 00:20:37,424
Protecting a Jedi master
is the role of the padawan.

243
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:40,464
And teaching is usually
the role of the master.

244
00:20:40,783 --> 00:20:43,303
Master Skywalker should be proud.

245
00:20:44,304 --> 00:20:45,303
Farewell.

246
00:20:45,903 --> 00:20:47,223
Thank you, Master.

247
00:20:50,224 --> 00:20:52,223
Commander,
let's get under way.

248
00:20:52,623 --> 00:20:54,383
Yes, General.
Ahead full.
