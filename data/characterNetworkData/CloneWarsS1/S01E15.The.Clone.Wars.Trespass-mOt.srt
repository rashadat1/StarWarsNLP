1
00:00:16,993 --> 00:00:18,672
<i>Republic outpost overrun!</i>

2
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:22,313
<i>The Jedi have lost all contact
with the clone security force</i>

3
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:25,634
<i>stationed on the bleak
snow-covered planet of Orto-Plutonia.</i>

4
00:00:25,754 --> 00:00:27,834
<i>Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker,</i>

5
00:00:27,954 --> 00:00:30,714
<i>accompanied by dignitaries
from the nearby moon of Pantora,</i>

6
00:00:30,954 --> 00:00:33,714
<i>are sent to investigate
the disappearance of the clone troopers</i>

7
00:00:34,074 --> 00:00:36,554
<i>on the desolate
and forbidding landscape.</i>

8
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,395
And this is the planet's
tropical zone.

9
00:00:44,515 --> 00:00:46,876
It's not Tatooine, that's for sure.

10
00:00:47,276 --> 00:00:49,756
Captain Rex,
have your men survey the area.

11
00:00:49,876 --> 00:00:52,836
Place as many sensor beacons
as you can before dark.

12
00:00:53,156 --> 00:00:55,316
Right away, sir.
Unload that gear!

13
00:00:55,436 --> 00:00:56,436
Let's move!

14
00:00:57,796 --> 00:01:00,717
Why would the Republic
want an outpost way out here?

15
00:01:01,196 --> 00:01:02,237
The chairman...

16
00:01:02,837 --> 00:01:05,637
of Orto-Plutonia requested it?
Why?

17
00:01:07,157 --> 00:01:08,317
General Kenobi.

18
00:01:08,798 --> 00:01:10,677
Chairman Cho, Senator Chuchi.

19
00:01:11,077 --> 00:01:13,758
I suggest you wait here
until we can secure the area.

20
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:16,318
I respect your judgment,
General Kenobi,

21
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,039
but I will go where I choose.
This is sovereign Pantora territory.

22
00:01:20,398 --> 00:01:23,759
I thought this planet was uninhabited,
and therefore, it's not aligned.

23
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:27,439
Our moon of Pantora
is the only civilization in this system.

24
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:30,439
I'm the one who asked the Senate
to protect this planet.

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,040
This wasteland belongs to us.

26
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,881
With all due respect, Chairman,

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,321
this is for the Senate to decide,
not us.

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,961
But the Jedi report to the Senate,

29
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:43,321
which is Senator Chuchi of Pantora.

30
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:46,842
Technically speaking, Master Jedi,
the chairman is correct.

31
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:49,962
Since the planet is uninhabited,
the moon of Pantora reserves the right

32
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:52,081
to continue as its protectorate.

33
00:01:52,402 --> 00:01:53,922
Point taken, Senator.

34
00:01:54,202 --> 00:01:56,442
Anakin, stay here with the senator
and the droids

35
00:01:56,562 --> 00:01:58,162
while we secure the base.

36
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:12,164
I don't get it.

37
00:02:12,644 --> 00:02:14,244
It must be Separatists.

38
00:02:14,364 --> 00:02:15,524
I am not sure.

39
00:02:17,124 --> 00:02:19,244
Might we go inside, Master Anakin?

40
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:21,364
R2 would like to
get out of the cold.

41
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:26,005
We'll go inside as soon as
Obi-Wan signals that it's safe.

42
00:02:30,886 --> 00:02:34,566
Do you think the Separatists are building
a forward base to attack Pantora?

43
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:37,166
I don't think we're dealing
with Separatists.

44
00:02:37,286 --> 00:02:39,127
These computers
haven't been touched.

45
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:41,526
Sir, our scouts have spotted
a droid base

46
00:02:41,646 --> 00:02:43,806
on the other side of the ice ridge.

47
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:05,488
By the look of things,
I'd say whoever attacked our base

48
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,209
took out the droids also.

49
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:10,249
Rex, help Anakin
place the sensor beacons.

50
00:03:10,369 --> 00:03:12,889
- You four, come with me.
- Yes, General.

51
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:14,370
Let's go.

52
00:03:34,611 --> 00:03:35,892
Did you find anything?

53
00:03:39,412 --> 00:03:41,332
I found some large footprints.

54
00:03:42,012 --> 00:03:44,492
Have one of your men make a cast.

55
00:03:54,773 --> 00:03:57,934
- Sensors are in place.
- I think I've found something.

56
00:03:58,453 --> 00:03:59,374
Blast it.

57
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:05,454
<i>685 to command.
There are too many of them!</i>

58
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:09,095
<i>They've overrun the base.
We need reinforcements!</i>

59
00:04:10,175 --> 00:04:13,415
- What was that?
- Whatever it was, it's a good warrior.

60
00:04:13,575 --> 00:04:16,616
The droid's log indicates they were
investigating the southern canyon.

61
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,176
Sounds like a good place to start.

62
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:25,417
I want the weapon system back online
and the shields operational.

63
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:27,617
There's no telling
what the Separatists have planned.

64
00:04:27,737 --> 00:04:29,696
Chairman, what makes you so certain

65
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:31,737
the Separatists
are behind this attack?

66
00:04:32,257 --> 00:04:33,657
Look around, Senator.

67
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:35,817
Isn't this carnage proof enough?

68
00:04:36,137 --> 00:04:38,377
I know,
but there are no dead droids here,

69
00:04:38,497 --> 00:04:41,178
no blast marks. The clones' injuries
were not consistent with what...

70
00:04:41,274 --> 00:04:44,258
So you're an expert on war now,
are you, Senator?

71
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:45,739
No, Chairman.

72
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,979
- No, I only...
- Let me tell you something, Senator.

73
00:04:49,098 --> 00:04:51,819
I have led our people
since before you were born.

74
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:55,179
I've seen 100 planets rise and fall
through force of arms.

75
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,619
If it's not the Separatists
out there,

76
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,819
then it's a malevolent
and aggressive enemy nonetheless.

77
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:01,460
And I will not let whoever it is
jeopardize the security

78
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,260
of the people of Pantora.

79
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,540
But if the Jedi discover
that the Separatists aren't behind this,

80
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,181
then perhaps
there is a peaceful resolution.

81
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,581
Senator, I am willing to fight and die
for my people.

82
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:17,741
It's time to ask yourself
if you are brave enough to do the same.

83
00:05:24,142 --> 00:05:26,102
There's some kind of reflection
up there.

84
00:05:26,262 --> 00:05:27,422
Do you see it?

85
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:28,383
Yep.

86
00:05:33,102 --> 00:05:35,503
Well, they know we're coming.
Let's go.

87
00:06:08,186 --> 00:06:10,666
Steady, Anakin.
They're only curious.

88
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:16,987
Let's not provoke them as the droids
and our troops must have done.

89
00:06:32,748 --> 00:06:34,708
Too bad we didn't bring 3PO along.

90
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,989
How do you plan on communicating
with these things?

91
00:06:37,109 --> 00:06:40,069
Patience.
Maybe they're smarter than we are.

92
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,749
Well, say something.

93
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,470
Just shut up.

94
00:07:11,992 --> 00:07:13,832
We come to you in peace.

95
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:16,552
We will not bring harm.

96
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:20,833
Peace.

97
00:07:53,276 --> 00:07:56,196
Glad you made it back, sir.
It's getting nasty out there.

98
00:07:56,636 --> 00:07:58,557
You don't know the half of it.

99
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:02,957
What did you find?

100
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:05,637
It seems we've stumbled
onto an inhabited planet.

101
00:08:05,998 --> 00:08:06,997
Impossible.

102
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:10,638
Our explorers have spent much time here
over the long history of Pantora.

103
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:13,238
No one lives here.
They're trespassers.

104
00:08:13,638 --> 00:08:16,598
With respect, Chairman Cho,
these creatures, the Talz,

105
00:08:16,718 --> 00:08:19,118
aren't advanced enough
to master space travel.

106
00:08:19,238 --> 00:08:21,719
I think they may have been here
longer than Pantora.

107
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:24,279
Whoever they are, they belong to us.

108
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:26,559
This whole system belongs to us.

109
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,639
Your Majesty,
if there are life forms here,

110
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,200
then the Senate
must decide jurisdiction.

111
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:33,640
They are savages.

112
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,320
Look at what they've done.
They've slaughtered your troops.

113
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,641
They only want to be left alone.

114
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,361
The droids attacked them, and I'm afraid
our outpost got caught in the middle.

115
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:45,281
They must be subdued.
They're dangerous.

116
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:47,761
Captain Rex,
prepare your troops for battle.

117
00:08:48,281 --> 00:08:50,761
We promised their chief
there would be no retaliation.

118
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:53,761
We've arranged a meeting
between their High Council and you

119
00:08:53,882 --> 00:08:56,002
and the senator.
They want peace.

120
00:08:56,122 --> 00:08:58,362
We can't send troopers.
They'll think we lied.

121
00:08:58,522 --> 00:09:00,642
These creatures
are little more than animals.

122
00:09:00,762 --> 00:09:03,603
You can't lie to an animal.
They can't be trusted.

123
00:09:03,922 --> 00:09:05,723
- But, Your Majesty...
- No!

124
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:07,963
It is obvious
these creatures are not covered

125
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,003
by the convention
of civilized systems.

126
00:09:10,123 --> 00:09:12,003
The Jedi Council
has no say in the matter.

127
00:09:12,683 --> 00:09:15,404
If the Jedi are able
to communicate with them,

128
00:09:15,924 --> 00:09:17,524
their status is in doubt.

129
00:09:17,844 --> 00:09:20,205
Do you stand against your chairman,
Senator?

130
00:09:20,365 --> 00:09:21,725
Of course not, Your Majesty.

131
00:09:21,884 --> 00:09:25,005
If we're going to meet with Thi-Sen
and his council at the arranged time,

132
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,284
we'll have to leave now.

133
00:09:35,526 --> 00:09:37,406
Sir, the gunships can't
take off in this storm.

134
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:39,606
We don't have enough bikes
for the entire platoon.

135
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:41,607
Have the rest of the men
stand by here.

136
00:09:41,726 --> 00:09:45,086
No matter what the chairman thinks,
we're not going to war.

137
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:06,529
Captain, put your men
on that ice ridge.

138
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:09,329
We will attack
as soon as the savages arrive.

139
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:13,329
- There will be no attack, Chairman.
- You will do as I command.

140
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,730
This planet
is under my jurisdiction.

141
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,250
Nothing is under your control,
Chairman.

142
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,090
The Talz are already here.

143
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,171
Their scouts have been following us
for some time.

144
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,371
It seems Thi-Sen doesn't trust you
any more than you trust him.

145
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:37,292
Rex, tell your men to stand down.

146
00:10:37,532 --> 00:10:40,052
Stay here and don't do anything
to provoke them.

147
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:41,372
Yes, sir.

148
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:51,452
- Your Highness.
- We have returned...

149
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:54,173
...as promised.

150
00:11:02,774 --> 00:11:04,854
These savages have no rights here.

151
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:08,455
Chieftain Thi-Sen
welcomes you to his home

152
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:11,815
and hopes you come in peace.
He wishes to be good neighbors,

153
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:14,335
but he does not wish you
to remain on his planet.

154
00:11:14,655 --> 00:11:17,616
Listen, droid,
translate everything I say,

155
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:19,855
and exactly as I say it.

156
00:11:20,336 --> 00:11:22,696
Would you like me to
represent Pantora in this matter?

157
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:26,697
Not on your life, Senator.
There will be no diplomacy this time.

158
00:11:27,256 --> 00:11:28,617
Listen here, you savage.

159
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,457
This world belongs
to the moon of Pantora.

160
00:11:31,577 --> 00:11:34,857
And as the Supreme Chairman
and exalted ruler of Pantora,

161
00:11:35,017 --> 00:11:38,657
you will not command me to leave
this planet or do anything else.

162
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,458
Your Majesty, we can't.

163
00:11:42,377 --> 00:11:44,018
Droid, tell him.

164
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,578
Oh dear.

165
00:11:46,658 --> 00:11:49,538
I recommend
a less confrontational discussion.

166
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:51,538
The Talz are easily provoked.

167
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:58,380
That didn't go over very well.

168
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,099
Chairman, I promised the Talz
that we would leave them in peace.

169
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,940
This is now an internal affair
of Pantora.

170
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,260
The great Thi-Sen, son of suns,

171
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,341
asks again that you leave
or it will mean war.

172
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:15,181
Then war it is.

173
00:12:36,183 --> 00:12:38,263
Troopers, mount up and follow me.

174
00:12:40,904 --> 00:12:41,864
What's up, General?

175
00:12:41,903 --> 00:12:43,344
You're going to have to
stay with the chairman

176
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:44,824
until we can work things out.

177
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:46,624
Protect him at all costs.

178
00:12:46,944 --> 00:12:48,744
Mount up! We're moving out!

179
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,744
Senator, you know
a pre-emptive strike is illegal.

180
00:12:52,904 --> 00:12:55,025
Isn't there anything you can do
to stop him?

181
00:12:55,145 --> 00:12:56,345
I'm afraid not.

182
00:12:56,465 --> 00:12:58,985
He has proclaimed this conflict
an internal affair.

183
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,985
You could petition the Jedi Council
for an intervention.

184
00:13:02,345 --> 00:13:04,385
You mean, without his authorization?

185
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:06,705
There must be someone on your moon
who could approve it.

186
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,946
The speaker of the assembly.
He has the power.

187
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:12,426
Let's get back to the base.
The storm is letting up.

188
00:13:12,546 --> 00:13:14,467
Maybe we can get
a transmission through.

189
00:13:21,987 --> 00:13:24,027
Here they are.
Fire when you're in range.

190
00:13:26,187 --> 00:13:29,428
Sir, with all due respect,
we're only here to protect you.

191
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:39,549
- Ambush!
- It's a trap. Kill them!

192
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,230
We're surrounded.
Defensive formation!

193
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:02,351
Chairman, get down!

194
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:17,993
We've got to hold out!

195
00:14:23,233 --> 00:14:25,913
Fall back!
First squad, cover the retreat!

196
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:26,914
Retreat?

197
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,234
We can't retreat from these animals.

198
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:34,754
Savages.

199
00:15:05,077 --> 00:15:06,517
<i>The assembly has decided</i>

200
00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:08,797
<i>that the actions of Chairman Cho
are out of order.</i>

201
00:15:09,237 --> 00:15:11,277
<i>Senator Chuchi,
you're given the authority</i>

202
00:15:11,397 --> 00:15:13,118
<i>to negotiate a peaceful settlement</i>

203
00:15:13,238 --> 00:15:15,638
<i>between the sovereign planet
of Pantora and the Talz.</i>

204
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:18,998
- It is decided then.
- Pilot, let's get moving.

205
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,200
Here they come!

206
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:48,801
Senator, now that you have
the authority,

207
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:51,081
how do you plan on making peace
with the Talz?

208
00:15:51,962 --> 00:15:55,202
Actually, Master Jedi,
since you're far more experienced,

209
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,682
I was hoping you could negotiate
on Pantora's behalf.

210
00:16:00,162 --> 00:16:02,042
I'm afraid that's not possible,
Senator.

211
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:05,523
But I don't understand.
The Jedi serve the Senate.

212
00:16:05,643 --> 00:16:07,443
- I must order you to...
- Senator,

213
00:16:07,563 --> 00:16:09,883
it is your people
the Talz are at war with.

214
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:13,364
If the violence is to stop, it is you
who must represent your people.

215
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:29,171
- Good to see you, sir.
- You okay, Rex?

216
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,571
- It's just a scratch.
- What's going on?

217
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,171
We're in quite a mess, sir.

218
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,812
11 dead, the rest wounded,
including the chairman.

219
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:42,612
Chairman, can you hear me?

220
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:44,772
Senator, good.

221
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:48,013
You must avenge me.

222
00:17:48,612 --> 00:17:51,253
As my final command
as chairman of Pantora,

223
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:54,613
I order you to destroy the Talz!

224
00:17:55,213 --> 00:17:57,494
I'm afraid
I cannot do that, Chairman.

225
00:17:57,614 --> 00:18:00,334
The Pantoran assembly
has called you out of order.

226
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,933
I am to negotiate peace.

227
00:18:02,654 --> 00:18:03,414
No.

228
00:18:04,054 --> 00:18:05,054
Impossible!

229
00:18:05,494 --> 00:18:06,214
Peace?

230
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:08,215
Never!

231
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:11,374
I died for our people.

232
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:18,655
Senator,

233
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,656
now is the time.

234
00:18:30,937 --> 00:18:33,056
Protocol droid, come with me.

235
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:35,097
3PO, get going.

236
00:18:35,377 --> 00:18:36,657
Yes, Master Ani.

237
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:00,460
Droid,

238
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,979
- translate for me.
- Yes, Mistress.

239
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,460
To die for one's people

240
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,181
is a great sacrifice.

241
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,300
To live for one's people,

242
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,541
an even greater sacrifice.

243
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:23,981
I choose to live for my people.

244
00:19:24,501 --> 00:19:25,582
What do you choose?

245
00:19:43,504 --> 00:19:45,264
He chooses to live as well.

246
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,143
We will leave Orto-Plutonia

247
00:19:47,263 --> 00:19:50,424
under the watchful eyes of the Talz
from this day forth

248
00:19:50,545 --> 00:19:52,264
and recognize your sovereignty

249
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,184
as a free and equal people.

250
00:20:22,027 --> 00:20:25,707
- Well done, Senator.
- Yes, most impressive.

251
00:20:25,947 --> 00:20:27,507
Thank you, Master Jedi.

252
00:20:28,188 --> 00:20:30,908
Now that you have created peace
between your people and the Talz,

253
00:20:32,188 --> 00:20:33,948
remember one crucial thing.

254
00:20:34,068 --> 00:20:35,468
Yes, Master Kenobi?

255
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:37,309
Make it last, Senator.

256
00:20:38,068 --> 00:20:39,189
Make it last.

257
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:42,669
And be an example to others,
so not only this war,

258
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:45,830
but every war waged
may come to an end as well.

259
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,269
I will.

260
00:20:47,702 --> 00:20:48,790
I promise you.
