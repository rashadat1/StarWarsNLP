1
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:18,990
<i>Viceroy Gunray escapes!</i>

2
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:22,310
<i>En route to Coruscant
to stand trial for war crimes,</i>

3
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,190
<i>evil Separatist leader Nute Gunray
has broken free of his Jedi escort.</i>

4
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,751
<i>With the help of
Count Dooku's sinister agents,</i>

5
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,471
<i>the villainous viceroy has
made a daring getaway.</i>

6
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>Alerted to the bold prison break,</i>

7
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:40,551
<i>Jedi Master Kit Fisto has traced
the stolen ship to a remote system,</i>

8
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:44,071
<i>hoping to recapture Gunray
and return him to justice.</i>

9
00:00:47,471 --> 00:00:50,272
I know we're in the middle
of nowhere, R6,

10
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,551
but that's the Republic beacon
we're looking for.

11
00:00:52,592 --> 00:00:54,311
Contact the Outer Rim command.

12
00:01:00,592 --> 00:01:01,792
Master Luminara,

13
00:01:01,872 --> 00:01:05,353
I have tracked the location of
our stolen ship to the Vassek system.

14
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,912
<i>So has your old padawan,
Nahdar Vebb.</i>

15
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:09,713
<i>He's already on the surface.</i>

16
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,913
It'll be great to see Nahdar again.

17
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:14,513
<i>I'll transmit the coordinates
for the rendezvous point.</i>

18
00:01:14,593 --> 00:01:15,913
<i>And, Master Fisto...</i>

19
00:01:15,953 --> 00:01:18,753
<i>sorry we lost that slimy double-dealer.</i>

20
00:01:18,873 --> 00:01:20,153
Don't worry, Ahsoka,

21
00:01:20,194 --> 00:01:21,714
we'll catch Gunray yet.

22
00:01:21,954 --> 00:01:22,953
<i>Good hunting.</i>

23
00:01:44,634 --> 00:01:46,274
Well, I can't see anything either.

24
00:01:46,595 --> 00:01:48,194
You'll be fine, R6.

25
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,795
Just keep a lookout for me, okay?

26
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:53,715
Nahdar.

27
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:56,796
Congratulations on passing the trials.

28
00:01:56,875 --> 00:02:00,675
I'm sorry the war prevented me from
seeing your training through to the end.

29
00:02:01,316 --> 00:02:02,716
You were missed, Master,

30
00:02:02,796 --> 00:02:06,116
but it is an honor to finally serve
beside you as a knight.

31
00:02:06,196 --> 00:02:06,916
General,

32
00:02:06,956 --> 00:02:10,196
we've pinpointed the tracking beacon's
location to the south end of the gorge.

33
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:12,076
Then let's have a look.

34
00:02:12,396 --> 00:02:13,996
Allow me to show the way.

35
00:02:21,637 --> 00:02:22,597
Charming.

36
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:24,677
Let's not keep the viceroy waiting.

37
00:02:25,557 --> 00:02:27,398
Niner, Bel,
look after the ships.

38
00:02:27,517 --> 00:02:28,478
Yes, sir.

39
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:34,277
No guards?

40
00:02:34,717 --> 00:02:35,478
That's odd.

41
00:02:35,558 --> 00:02:36,878
The entrance looks sealed.

42
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,558
We specialize in making entrances.

43
00:02:42,238 --> 00:02:44,198
This will make less noise.

44
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,838
Patience, the both of you.

45
00:02:46,238 --> 00:02:48,479
A second look usually pays off.

46
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:51,479
What's this?

47
00:02:59,536 --> 00:03:02,509
- Smell that?
- Smells like droids to me.

48
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:07,593
It's too dark to see anything.

49
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:18,207
I sense there's something here.

50
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,647
Scanners are negative, General.

51
00:03:30,488 --> 00:03:32,008
Well, that was something.

52
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:41,688
<i>All droids stay on guard.</i>

53
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:43,809
<i>Be ready for anything.</i>

54
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:44,808
Roger, roger.

55
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:51,649
<i>Double shifts for everyone.</i>

56
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:53,649
Uh, Viceroy?

57
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:56,129
<i>You must protect me at all costs.</i>

58
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,809
Uh, Viceroy,
the Jedi are here.

59
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,449
<i>I know they're near.</i>

60
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:02,929
<i>Once those Jedi pick up my trail,</i>

61
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,170
<i>they never leave me alone.</i>

62
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,210
They're right behind you.

63
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,530
<i>What? Where?</i>

64
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:08,770
<i>Do something.</i>

65
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:10,291
<i>You, blast them!</i>

66
00:04:16,142 --> 00:04:19,115
- Have you ever killed a Jedi?
- No, never.

67
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:20,363
Me neither.

68
00:04:27,173 --> 00:04:29,763
Don't even think about it,
Republic dogs.

69
00:04:32,756 --> 00:04:34,916
I didn't forget to teach you restraint,

70
00:04:34,996 --> 00:04:36,276
did I,
my old Padawan?

71
00:04:36,717 --> 00:04:38,077
I am sorry, Master.

72
00:04:38,156 --> 00:04:39,597
I got carried away.

73
00:04:39,676 --> 00:04:42,917
Those who have power
should restrain themselves from using it.

74
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:45,997
<i>Lieutenant,
did you get them?</i>

75
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,717
No, but we have you, Viceroy.

76
00:04:48,797 --> 00:04:51,438
<i>You have nothing, Jedi fools.</i>

77
00:04:51,517 --> 00:04:54,158
<i>I welcome you to your doom.</i>

78
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:58,037
The tracking beacon.

79
00:04:58,118 --> 00:04:59,438
They knew we were coming.

80
00:04:59,518 --> 00:05:01,638
I should have known
Gunray wasn't here.

81
00:05:01,678 --> 00:05:02,758
At the first sight of us,

82
00:05:02,838 --> 00:05:05,198
he would have run off screaming
like the coward he is.

83
00:05:07,278 --> 00:05:10,518
<i>I apologize for the deception,
Master Jedi.</i>

84
00:05:10,838 --> 00:05:11,839
Count Dooku.

85
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:15,239
You have a great talent
for unexpected appearances.

86
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,239
<i>It's a shame you came so far
to be frustrated.</i>

87
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:21,760
<i>While the viceroy is
unavailable for capture,</i>

88
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:24,959
<i>allow me to offer you
an alternative prize.</i>

89
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,039
This has got to be a trap.

90
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,240
It looks like Dooku is trying to
catch someone,

91
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,839
and we are the bait.

92
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,600
But who has the trap been set to catch?

93
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,560
Shall we find out?

94
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:08,962
This place looks like a shrine
to that strange warrior.

95
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,763
This is the lair of General Grievous.

96
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:32,723
Yes, my lord?

97
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:37,444
<i>General, the ongoing stalemate
in the war has become unacceptable.</i>

98
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:40,684
<i>There is concern
you have lost your focus.</i>

99
00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:44,284
<i>Lord Sidious demands
more dramatic results...</i>

100
00:06:44,324 --> 00:06:46,764
<i>more dead Jedi.</i>

101
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:49,564
You expect victory over Jedi,

102
00:06:49,645 --> 00:06:52,884
but all you give me to fight them
is battle droids.

103
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:04,405
These must be trophies
taken from the Jedi he's murdered.

104
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:06,485
There are so many.

105
00:07:07,646 --> 00:07:10,725
Why would Dooku want to
set a trap for his best general?

106
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,726
It doesn't make sense.

107
00:07:12,926 --> 00:07:16,006
Are we the bait,
or is Grievous the bait?

108
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:18,286
We must consider who this trap is for.

109
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:20,966
<i>General, your droid is tracking
an incoming ship.</i>

110
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:23,927
It matches a description
of General Grievous' fighter.

111
00:07:24,006 --> 00:07:24,927
It's headed our way.

112
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:28,007
Keep out of sight
and stand by for further orders.

113
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,247
Capturing Grievous
could turn the tide of the war.

114
00:07:31,447 --> 00:07:33,367
And if he doesn't know we're here,

115
00:07:33,727 --> 00:07:35,447
we could take him down easy.

116
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,567
Don't underestimate him.

117
00:07:37,688 --> 00:07:38,928
We'll need a plan.

118
00:07:58,048 --> 00:07:59,169
Guards?

119
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:00,648
Gore?

120
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:04,448
Gore, where are you?

121
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:10,129
Welcome home, General.

122
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:12,650
I'm afraid
I must request your surrender.

123
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,490
Cooperate, Grievous,

124
00:08:15,609 --> 00:08:17,730
and perhaps the Senate will be merciful.

125
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,610
It is you who shall get no mercy.

126
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:33,970
Cables!

127
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:42,651
Don't let him go!

128
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,531
We got him.

129
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:46,771
Don't let him cut the lines!

130
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,491
Hold him.

131
00:08:58,692 --> 00:09:00,332
Don't make me destroy you.

132
00:09:10,773 --> 00:09:12,492
Come and get me.

133
00:09:22,214 --> 00:09:23,454
Cut him off!

134
00:09:49,895 --> 00:09:52,335
- Where'd he go?
- The clones got in the way.

135
00:09:52,455 --> 00:09:53,655
I could have taken him.

136
00:09:56,176 --> 00:09:58,136
Let's take care of our wounded.

137
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:06,016
Doctor, where are you?

138
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,616
Don't be upset with me, Master.

139
00:10:08,736 --> 00:10:10,016
If you were a better fighter,

140
00:10:10,136 --> 00:10:12,216
we would not be having
this conversation.

141
00:10:14,216 --> 00:10:16,337
Look what you let those Jedi
do to you.

142
00:10:16,457 --> 00:10:18,056
You're a walking scrap pile.

143
00:10:18,377 --> 00:10:19,337
What a mess.

144
00:10:19,457 --> 00:10:23,097
It's going to take me forever
to get you back into decent shape.

145
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,337
I'll go fetch your spare parts.

146
00:10:32,858 --> 00:10:35,617
What happened to my bodyguards?

147
00:10:35,698 --> 00:10:38,138
They were remotely deactivated
for recharge.

148
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:39,458
I thought you did it.

149
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:52,259
Lock down the perimeter.

150
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,820
Let me go after Grievous myself,
Master.

151
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,139
Patience, Nahdar.

152
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,299
You may no longer be a padawan,

153
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,860
<i>but you are not ready
to take on Grievous.</i>

154
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,420
<i>It's time we retreated.</i>

155
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,941
You are not going anywhere.

156
00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:26,141
It looks like we're going to
have to fight after all.

157
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:29,341
<i>- Green scout to watcher base.
- Copy.</i>

158
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,742
<i>This is watcher base, over.</i>

159
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,461
<i>Contact the fleet at Besteene.</i>

160
00:11:32,741 --> 00:11:35,382
Inform them we've engaged Grievous
and require reinforcements.

161
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:36,301
<i>Right away, sir.</i>

162
00:11:41,342 --> 00:11:43,542
Better warm up the shuttle's
long-range transmitter.

163
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:02,024
Get out of there, R6.
Now!

164
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:18,504
R6? R6?!

165
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,905
<i>You've run out of time.</i>

166
00:12:22,104 --> 00:12:23,545
Why don't you come out, General?

167
00:12:23,665 --> 00:12:26,224
Show us some of that Separatist hospitality.

168
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:27,465
<i>Patience.</i>

169
00:12:27,584 --> 00:12:28,745
<i>In the meantime,</i>

170
00:12:28,865 --> 00:12:32,344
<i>please experience
all my home has to offer.</i>

171
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:37,065
<i>It has been prepared
for uninvited guests like you.</i>

172
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:40,711
I have a bad feeling about this.

173
00:12:57,671 --> 00:12:59,792
General, I know you're watching.

174
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:02,312
We've seen the lower levels
of your home.

175
00:13:02,632 --> 00:13:04,392
We're not impressed.

176
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:09,192
Good, Jedi, good.

177
00:13:09,313 --> 00:13:12,593
You will provide some sport for me yet.

178
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:18,073
Gore, time to entertain our guests.

179
00:13:26,113 --> 00:13:26,953
Stand firm.

180
00:13:27,554 --> 00:13:29,754
There might be worse things here
than Grievous.

181
00:13:31,874 --> 00:13:33,554
Looks like you're right about that, sir.

182
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,074
Good-bye, Jedi.

183
00:13:46,555 --> 00:13:48,595
Master, the armor patches
are getting cold,

184
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:51,915
and contrary to your belief,
I do have other things to do.

185
00:13:52,635 --> 00:13:54,635
Proceed with my repair.

186
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:58,276
Sometimes I wonder
why you submitted to the changes.

187
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:01,635
Improvements!
I submit to no one.

188
00:14:01,755 --> 00:14:05,076
I chose them.
Now get on with it.

189
00:14:14,156 --> 00:14:16,917
There may be some discomfort.

190
00:14:31,557 --> 00:14:32,838
Shoot him, Commander!

191
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,480
Grievous is going to pay for this.

192
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,760
I will destroy him.

193
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,160
I understand your pain,

194
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,160
but you forget your teachings, Nahdar.

195
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,560
Revenge is not the Jedi way.

196
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,040
But in this war, strength prevails.

197
00:15:24,681 --> 00:15:26,281
The rules have changed.

198
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:29,361
Perhaps you are the one
who has changed.

199
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,201
Come now,
we need to keep moving.

200
00:15:41,761 --> 00:15:45,322
Let's see if Gore is finished
playing with the Jedi.

201
00:15:47,442 --> 00:15:48,202
Huh?

202
00:15:48,642 --> 00:15:49,802
Where are they?

203
00:15:50,842 --> 00:15:51,682
Gore?

204
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:59,883
Master, you have an incoming
transmission from Count Dooku.

205
00:16:01,642 --> 00:16:06,203
<i>General, I understand
the Jedi have infiltrated your lair.</i>

206
00:16:06,723 --> 00:16:09,323
<i>Your recent defeats at their hands</i>

207
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:14,084
<i>have shaken my faith in your ability
to lead the droid army.</i>

208
00:16:14,363 --> 00:16:18,763
<i>I'm sure you can understand my need
to reassess your effectiveness.</i>

209
00:16:19,764 --> 00:16:20,604
You!

210
00:16:20,764 --> 00:16:23,084
You deactivated my guards.

211
00:16:23,164 --> 00:16:28,124
You let the Jedi in here
so you would test me.

212
00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:32,005
<i>I do hope you emerge victorious.</i>

213
00:16:32,445 --> 00:16:33,164
Ha!

214
00:16:34,085 --> 00:16:36,125
<i>- It's time for you to prove...
- Oops.</i>

215
00:16:36,645 --> 00:16:37,725
All right, Count.

216
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:40,085
I'll play your little game.

217
00:16:41,246 --> 00:16:43,765
In your condition, you need to rest.

218
00:16:44,165 --> 00:16:47,085
I will rest when the Jedi are dead.

219
00:16:54,686 --> 00:16:55,726
You were right, Master.

220
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,686
That exit must lead to the control room.

221
00:17:06,646 --> 00:17:08,446
Oh, what have we here?

222
00:17:08,566 --> 00:17:10,647
The uninvited guests.

223
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:11,846
Let's go.

224
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:13,887
Master,

225
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:16,207
<i>the Jedi are about
to enter the control room.</i>

226
00:17:17,487 --> 00:17:18,927
Nahdar, inside.
Hurry!

227
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:20,608
No, you go.
I will hold him off.

228
00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:22,208
There's no time to argue.

229
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:23,328
<i>We can't just run.</i>

230
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:24,487
<i>We must finish him.</i>

231
00:17:26,728 --> 00:17:27,808
Nahdar, hurry!

232
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:31,168
I have been waiting for this.

233
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,048
Nahdar!

234
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,489
Greetings, young Jedi.

235
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:49,529
<i>Where is your master?</i>

236
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:50,689
How exciting.

237
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,609
<i>You will find out soon enough.</i>

238
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,289
You can't defeat us all.

239
00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:56,210
Of course I can.

240
00:17:58,970 --> 00:17:59,970
Get him, Master.

241
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,130
Kill him.

242
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,930
Wait.
Where's the other Jedi?

243
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,610
Oh, no.

244
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:21,131
No.

245
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:27,252
<i>I will kill you all.</i>

246
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,332
<i>Do you hear me, Jedi?</i>

247
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,443
<i>Do you hear me?!</i>

248
00:18:32,474 --> 00:18:33,353
R6?

249
00:18:33,514 --> 00:18:34,354
Is that you?

250
00:18:36,194 --> 00:18:37,874
Meet me at the south landing platform.

251
00:18:37,954 --> 00:18:39,074
I'll be right there.

252
00:18:39,355 --> 00:18:42,114
I'm coming for you next, Fisto.

253
00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:45,434
I'll be gone by the time you get here.

254
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:56,129
R6, I'm at the platform.

255
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:57,289
Where are you?

256
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:04,169
Going somewhere?

257
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,370
Huh?

258
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,491
You might have been
a proud warrior once,

259
00:19:29,611 --> 00:19:32,331
but now you're just a pawn
in Dooku's game.

260
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:35,571
I wield great power, Jedi fool.

261
00:19:41,372 --> 00:19:43,852
That power will only consume you.

262
00:20:15,454 --> 00:20:18,294
How quickly power can change hands.

263
00:20:18,574 --> 00:20:21,534
Surrender, and I promise
you will die quickly.

264
00:20:29,935 --> 00:20:30,895
Stop him!

265
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:38,895
Let's go home, R6.

266
00:20:46,256 --> 00:20:49,856
Count Dooku,
the Jedi have been defeated.

267
00:20:49,936 --> 00:20:53,776
<i>Victory over the clones
and the young Jedi was expected,</i>

268
00:20:53,936 --> 00:20:56,617
<i>but to best a Jedi master...</i>

269
00:20:56,696 --> 00:21:00,896
<i>This is truly an accomplishment
worthy of recognition.</i>

270
00:21:01,377 --> 00:21:03,977
The Jedi Fisto escaped.

271
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,057
<i>So there is room for improvement.</i>

272
00:21:14,377 --> 00:21:16,098
What about your former padawan?

273
00:21:16,498 --> 00:21:18,457
His heart was in the right place,

274
00:21:18,498 --> 00:21:21,378
but he tried to answer
Grievous' power with his own.

275
00:21:21,617 --> 00:21:25,858
To answer power with power,
the Jedi way, this is not.

276
00:21:26,178 --> 00:21:30,978
In this war, a danger there is,
of losing who we are.
