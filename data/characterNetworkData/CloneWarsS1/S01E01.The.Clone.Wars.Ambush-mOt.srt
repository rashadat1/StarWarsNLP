1
00:00:17,468 --> 00:00:19,050
<i>A galaxy, divided by war.</i>

2
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,156
<i>Peaceful worlds must choose sides
or face the threat of invasion.</i>

3
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:28,452
<i>Republican Separatist armies vie
for the allegiance of neutral planets.</i>

4
00:00:28,615 --> 00:00:31,603
<i>Desparate to build a Republic supply
base in the system of Toydaria,</i>

5
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:36,280
<i>Jedi Master Yoda travels to secret
negotiations on a remote neutral moon.</i>

6
00:00:42,034 --> 00:00:45,590
We are getting no signal from
the Republic, Your Highness.

7
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:47,595
I don't see anything.

8
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:51,141
It is not like the Jedi
to be late.

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,226
Greetings, King Katuunko.

10
00:00:57,497 --> 00:01:00,597
- Who are you?
- I am only a messenger, Majesty.

11
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:03,009
My master wishes to speak with you.

12
00:01:05,589 --> 00:01:06,663
<i>Katuunko,</i>

13
00:01:07,262 --> 00:01:11,022
<i>great king of Toydaria,
forgive my intrusion.</i>

14
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:12,422
Count Dooku.

15
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:15,181
<i>I am aware Master Yoda</i>

16
00:01:15,431 --> 00:01:18,941
<i>hopes you will allow the Jedi
to build a Republic base in your system</i>

17
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:22,460
<i>in exchange for protection,
correct?</i>

18
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,756
Your spies serve you well, Count.

19
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:28,673
<i>I ask, how can the Jedi protect you...</i>

20
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,017
<i>if they cannot protect themselves?</i>

21
00:01:32,574 --> 00:01:36,055
Toydarian Royal Delegation, this is
the Republican envoy, please respond.

22
00:01:37,895 --> 00:01:40,334
General, the Toydarians beacon is
active on the moon,

23
00:01:40,584 --> 00:01:43,053
but all our transmissions are
being jammed.

24
00:01:50,432 --> 00:01:52,779
We caught them by surprise, all right.

25
00:01:57,768 --> 00:01:58,886
We're losing our shields.

26
00:01:59,144 --> 00:02:01,128
Too late, it is.
Sprung is the trap.

27
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:07,927
- I must get you to safety, General.
- Retreat you must.

28
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:10,567
On the moon below, is my mission.

29
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,685
There, I must go.

30
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:19,523
I suppose you and your droid
armies can do better?

31
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:21,462
<i>Without a doubt.</i>

32
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:25,179
<i>I sense you are one who respects
strength, Your Highness.</i>

33
00:02:25,582 --> 00:02:27,940
<i>Our droid armies outnumber the</i>

34
00:02:28,103 --> 00:02:30,001
<i>Republic clones 100 to 1.</i>

35
00:02:30,388 --> 00:02:31,547
Perhaps.

36
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:33,261
But I have heard

37
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:36,791
that a single Jedi
equals 100 battle droids.

38
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:40,438
Quickly now,
reach the planets surface we must.

39
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:42,837
In an escape pod, sir?

40
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:44,715
The enemy will fire
at anything we launch.

41
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,131
Then launch all of them,
you will.

42
00:02:54,105 --> 00:02:57,353
<i>Master Yoda's powers have
been greatly exaggerated.</i>

43
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,913
That remains to be seen, Count.

44
00:03:00,277 --> 00:03:01,236
<i>Indeed.</i>

45
00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:03,839
<i>But when you decide to join us,</i>

46
00:03:04,175 --> 00:03:06,637
<i>my apprentice will contact me.</i>

47
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,546
Hang on.
Almost...

48
00:03:25,447 --> 00:03:26,933
What a terrible shot.

49
00:03:27,305 --> 00:03:29,942
Ah, well,
it's my programming.

50
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:34,428
That was a close one.

51
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:36,222
General, I think we're out of range.

52
00:03:36,472 --> 00:03:37,656
I agree,

53
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,741
but entering another trap, we are.

54
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,542
Are you sure?

55
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:45,059
A disturbance in the force,
there is.

56
00:03:49,276 --> 00:03:50,372
My Lord,

57
00:03:50,613 --> 00:03:53,017
Master Yoda's warship
has fled the system.

58
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:56,856
What further evidence do you require
of the Jedi's weakness?

59
00:04:01,864 --> 00:04:04,134
This is King Katuunko. Speak.

60
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,374
<i>Master Yoda would like to
talk with you, sir.</i>

61
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,724
<i>A pleasure it is, to hear your voice,
Your Highness.</i>

62
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:14,251
<i>Master Yoda of the Jedi Council,
this is.</i>

63
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:15,653
Master Jedi,

64
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:19,041
I thought perhaps Count Dooku
had frightened you off.

65
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,923
<i>Delayed have I been,
but not too far away am I now.</i>

66
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:27,006
<i>Unaware I was, Count Dooku was
invited to our meeting.</i>

67
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,640
The Count invited himself.

68
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,873
He assures me that in this time of war,

69
00:04:32,036 --> 00:04:35,245
his droids can offer my world
greater security than your Jedi.

70
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,109
<i>Hmmm, a matter of debate that is.</i>

71
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:41,917
Your Majesty might prefer
more than words.

72
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:43,443
What do you have in mind?

73
00:04:43,756 --> 00:04:47,442
If Yoda is indeed the Jedi warrior
you believe he is,

74
00:04:48,032 --> 00:04:49,400
let him prove it.

75
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,714
Allow me to send my best troops
to capture him.

76
00:04:52,964 --> 00:04:55,753
If he escapes, join the Republic.

77
00:04:56,234 --> 00:04:58,464
But should my droids defeat Yoda,

78
00:04:58,808 --> 00:05:01,478
consider an alliance with the Separatists.

79
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:05,036
I did not request Yoda's presence here
to test him in battle.

80
00:05:05,398 --> 00:05:07,754
<i>Accept the challenge, I do,
Your Highness.</i>

81
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:10,355
<i>Arrive by nightfall, I will.</i>

82
00:05:11,631 --> 00:05:14,634
Master Yoda must be given a fair fight.

83
00:05:15,051 --> 00:05:16,980
My dear King Katuunko,

84
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:19,136
I would have it no other way.

85
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,584
Beautiful, this moon is.

86
00:05:30,325 --> 00:05:32,531
Amazing, the universe is.

87
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,988
There's gotta be a full
battalion in there.

88
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:44,824
Probably packin' armor, too.

89
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:47,345
We'll have somethin' for 'em.

90
00:05:51,242 --> 00:05:53,182
I'm deploying my forces, master.

91
00:05:53,534 --> 00:05:56,164
<i>Yoda has made a grave mistake,</i>

92
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:58,541
<i>straying this far from Coruscant.</i>

93
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:02,660
I will see the Jedi gets his
"fair fight".

94
00:06:03,313 --> 00:06:04,802
Carry only what you need.

95
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,183
Too much weight slow you down,
it will.

96
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,489
Destroy Ventress, your weapons will not.

97
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:13,333
Come, Lieutenant. Hurry, we must.

98
00:06:13,827 --> 00:06:16,376
Sir, the rendezvous point is that way.

99
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:18,730
As is our enemy.

100
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:22,775
To reach our goal,
a straight path, we will not follow.

101
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:24,734
Let's move it, boys.

102
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:28,053
Find Master Yoda.

103
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,731
Ahh, what does he look like?

104
00:06:31,211 --> 00:06:33,915
He'll be the small shriveled green one,

105
00:06:34,078 --> 00:06:35,531
with the light saber.

106
00:06:36,227 --> 00:06:39,139
Small, huh?
Don't worry, Supreme Leader,

107
00:06:39,302 --> 00:06:40,884
we'll take care of him.

108
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:56,729
I think I see them.

109
00:06:56,892 --> 00:06:59,893
They're hiding deep in the trees.
Fire on sector 11.

110
00:07:09,074 --> 00:07:12,448
At ease be, my friends.
Within range, we are not.

111
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:19,208
Hold it, hold it.

112
00:07:20,636 --> 00:07:22,446
I said, hold it!

113
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:24,205
That's far enough!

114
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,569
I mean it! Stop!

115
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:28,144
I said, stop!

116
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,401
- We're too big to fit in there.
- No, we're not. Watch this.

117
00:07:38,317 --> 00:07:40,840
- You were right.
- Next time, listen to orders.

118
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,559
Those tanks are too big to follow.

119
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,416
See, see?

120
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:48,198
Size is not everything.

121
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:52,918
Smaller in number are we,
but larger in mind.

122
00:07:53,712 --> 00:07:56,667
Do you have any idea
what the General was talkin' about?

123
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,395
How should I know?
There's no figurin' a Jedi Master.

124
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:02,579
Infantry, advance.

125
00:08:04,136 --> 00:08:05,754
Go get 'em, boys.

126
00:08:11,202 --> 00:08:12,912
Sir, there are two patrols
coming in on foot.

127
00:08:13,303 --> 00:08:16,832
Now is the time to face the enemy,
Lieutenant. Ambush them, we will.

128
00:08:20,023 --> 00:08:22,230
- We'll flank them from the south.
- Right, let's move.

129
00:08:35,185 --> 00:08:36,225
What was that?

130
00:08:36,998 --> 00:08:38,360
Blast him!

131
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:43,559
Look, little green life form.

132
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,992
You bucket head, that's the Jedi!

133
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,388
He is a little one.
Blast him!

134
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,455
Split up by squad and spread out.

135
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,299
- Roger, roger.
- Roger, roger.

136
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:05,977
OK, clankers, suck laser!

137
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:17,734
- Where's the General?
- I don't know. We got separated.

138
00:09:18,902 --> 00:09:20,023
Clankers!

139
00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:23,891
Fall back!
There are too many of them.

140
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,009
He's around here somewhere.

141
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:39,487
Hey, get off of me!

142
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,733
Don't move.

143
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:54,124
<i>The Jedi destroyed
our advance troops.</i>

144
00:09:55,296 --> 00:09:58,601
Master Yoda is living up to
my expectations.

145
00:09:59,017 --> 00:09:59,976
Commander,

146
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:02,520
have you pinpointed the Jedi's location?

147
00:10:03,032 --> 00:10:05,360
<i>Affirmative. The clones gave
away their position.</i>

148
00:10:05,712 --> 00:10:08,497
<i>Our heavy troops are moving
to engage them now.</i>

149
00:10:13,993 --> 00:10:16,276
I hope the General reaches the
rendezvous point.

150
00:10:16,558 --> 00:10:18,465
This should buy him time.

151
00:10:30,926 --> 00:10:33,231
- Lieutenant, can you walk?
- I think I'm okay.

152
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:36,231
Die, Republic dog!

153
00:10:49,217 --> 00:10:50,968
What are we gonna do, sir?

154
00:10:58,137 --> 00:11:00,184
- What's the General doing?
- Keep blasting!

155
00:11:06,036 --> 00:11:07,619
Hey, what's going on?

156
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,460
Get out of the way, all of you!

157
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:16,539
I'm having a serious malfunction!

158
00:11:18,182 --> 00:11:19,292
Don't shoot!

159
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,234
I'm on your side!

160
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:29,832
- You found us just in time, sir.
- Left behind,

161
00:11:29,995 --> 00:11:31,176
no one will be.

162
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:36,389
Rollers, inbound.

163
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:43,358
Retreat!

164
00:11:43,462 --> 00:11:44,973
Cover you, I will.

165
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:56,891
<i>Republic troops are injured,
the Jedi is in full retreat, Supreme Leader.</i>

166
00:11:57,415 --> 00:11:59,943
Good. Pursue them without delay.

167
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:02,994
The contest is not over yet.

168
00:12:04,731 --> 00:12:05,686
Master Yoda,

169
00:12:06,076 --> 00:12:08,524
I hear you're having trouble
with the droid army?

170
00:12:09,115 --> 00:12:11,361
<i>Trouble?
I know nothing of this trouble.</i>

171
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:13,804
<i>Look forward to our meeting soon,
I do.</i>

172
00:12:15,798 --> 00:12:18,603
The Jedi won't allude me for long.

173
00:12:28,797 --> 00:12:31,798
Are you sure we should go in there,
General? There's no way out.

174
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:34,197
Now rest, we must.

175
00:12:58,245 --> 00:12:59,350
We're low on ammo, sir.

176
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:03,109
Only 2 grenades,
and 1 rocket for the launcher.

177
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:04,993
Against a battalion?

178
00:13:05,463 --> 00:13:06,588
Forget it, we've lost.

179
00:13:07,118 --> 00:13:09,012
So certain of defeat, are you?

180
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:14,760
With respect, General,
maybe you should go on.

181
00:13:14,923 --> 00:13:16,026
Let us slow 'em down.

182
00:13:18,386 --> 00:13:21,407
All around us, is that with
which we need to prevail, is.

183
00:13:25,776 --> 00:13:27,061
Come, sit.

184
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,782
Your helmets, remove them.

185
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,020
Your faces I wish to see.

186
00:13:33,382 --> 00:13:36,580
There's not much to look at here, sir.
We all share the same face.

187
00:13:36,962 --> 00:13:38,775
Deceive you, eyes can.

188
00:13:38,938 --> 00:13:42,578
In the force, very different
each one of you are.

189
00:13:43,553 --> 00:13:46,300
Rys, always focused on the enemy,
are you.

190
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:50,071
For inspiration, look to yourself,

191
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,004
and those beside you.

192
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:56,496
Jeck, concerned about weapons you are.

193
00:13:57,155 --> 00:13:59,331
Weapons do not win battles.

194
00:13:59,494 --> 00:14:01,264
Your mind, powerful it is.

195
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:05,320
Outthink the droids, you can.

196
00:14:06,543 --> 00:14:08,961
Thire, rush not into fights.

197
00:14:09,124 --> 00:14:10,410
Long is the war.

198
00:14:10,915 --> 00:14:13,410
Only by surviving it, will you prevail.

199
00:14:14,473 --> 00:14:15,432
Yes.

200
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:19,513
Clones you may be,

201
00:14:19,747 --> 00:14:22,126
but the force resides in all life forms.

202
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,486
Use it, you can, to quiet your mind.

203
00:14:36,165 --> 00:14:37,123
Tanks.

204
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:41,559
- Is that the best they can throw at us?
- Yeah, but I've only got one shot left.

205
00:14:41,722 --> 00:14:43,321
- Greet them, I will.
- General,

206
00:14:43,603 --> 00:14:46,280
you don't plan to take that whole
column by yourself?

207
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:50,839
Have you three, I do.
Outnumbered are they.

208
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:55,649
Know the time to help me, you will.

209
00:15:08,432 --> 00:15:10,766
It's the Jedi!
Block his escape!

210
00:15:11,937 --> 00:15:13,192
Prepare to fire!

211
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,680
<i>Supreme Leader, we found the Jedi.</i>

212
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:22,759
Excellent. Where is he?

213
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,504
<i>He's just sitting here,
in front of our tanks.</i>

214
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:27,478
Shoot him!
Shoot him now!

215
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,411
Quickly!
Ready, aim, fire!

216
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:33,397
Fire!

217
00:15:42,165 --> 00:15:43,434
He's gone under the tank!

218
00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:55,128
Oh, no!

219
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:58,768
Run for it!

220
00:15:58,931 --> 00:16:00,623
But I just got promoted.

221
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:08,470
Doesn't look like the General needs
help to me.

222
00:16:14,965 --> 00:16:16,264
We've got him in our sights.

223
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,060
That's a lot of smoke,
for a surrender.

224
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,486
Report. What's going on over there?

225
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:37,019
224, come in.

226
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,178
Where is 224?

227
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:41,890
<i>Destroyed, Supreme Leader.</i>

228
00:16:42,053 --> 00:16:44,562
<i>The Jedi has overrun our position
and...</i>

229
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:49,615
I think perhaps all those stories
about the Jedi are true.

230
00:16:51,098 --> 00:16:53,739
The fight isn't over yet, Majesty.

231
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:07,240
The General's cutting 'em up.

232
00:17:08,055 --> 00:17:09,161
We've got trouble.

233
00:17:09,418 --> 00:17:11,811
Clankers sent reinforcements.

234
00:17:12,974 --> 00:17:16,107
General's too busy with that tank.
He won't see 'em coming.

235
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,493
I think I know how to deal with them.

236
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,687
Yeah! Great shot, sir!

237
00:17:45,042 --> 00:17:46,239
That's givin' it to the clankers.

238
00:17:54,261 --> 00:17:56,955
Learned something today,
have you, Lieutenant?

239
00:17:57,388 --> 00:17:59,595
I think we all did, General.

240
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:07,273
Come, behind schedule are we.
Not polite to be late.

241
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,189
You were right, Count Dooku.

242
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,400
One Jedi is not worth 100 battle droids.

243
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:24,011
More like, 1,000.

244
00:18:24,766 --> 00:18:27,387
I'm sorry, but I will be
joining the Republic.

245
00:18:27,822 --> 00:18:30,840
<i>I urge you to reconsider, wise king.</i>

246
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:32,905
<i>I promise you won't regret it.</i>

247
00:18:33,188 --> 00:18:36,360
Your agent also promised me
Yoda would get a fair fight.

248
00:18:36,836 --> 00:18:39,264
I will not deal with those
who break their words.

249
00:18:40,408 --> 00:18:41,742
<i>So be it.</i>

250
00:18:41,905 --> 00:18:45,925
<i>Perhaps our negotiations will be
more fruitful with your successor.</i>

251
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:47,701
<i>Ventress, kill him!</i>

252
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:06,175
Jedi Master Yoda.

253
00:19:06,617 --> 00:19:09,645
I am very pleased to meet you,
at last.

254
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:12,934
Share the feeling, I do,
King Katoonku.

255
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:17,773
Failed you, Ventress has,

256
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:18,812
Count.

257
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:21,772
I don't fear you, Jedi.

258
00:19:22,314 --> 00:19:24,958
Strong you are with the dark side,
young one,

259
00:19:25,121 --> 00:19:26,571
but not that strong.

260
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:31,870
Still much to learn, you have.

261
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,288
Surrender, you should.

262
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:57,786
In the end,

263
00:19:57,949 --> 00:20:00,241
cowards are those
who follow the dark side.

264
00:20:01,063 --> 00:20:04,159
<i>It's a pity I wasn't there in person,
my old master.</i>

265
00:20:04,598 --> 00:20:05,944
A pity, indeed,

266
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,639
my fallen apprentice.

267
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:12,598
Perhaps now,
begin negotiations, we can.

268
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:15,347
That is not necessary, my friend.

269
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:16,996
You have my faith.

270
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:20,606
Toydaria would be honored
to host a Republic base.

271
00:20:20,842 --> 00:20:21,787
My people...

272
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,529
are at your service.

273
00:20:24,734 --> 00:20:25,853
Your Majesty,

274
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:27,808
fail you, we will not.
