1
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:18,594
<i>A planet under siege!</i>

2
00:00:18,994 --> 00:00:21,074
<i>Separatist forces mercilessly batter</i>

3
00:00:21,235 --> 00:00:23,315
<i>the beautiful and elegant world
of Christophsis.</i>

4
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:26,275
<i>Unable to defend themselves
any longer,</i>

5
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:29,636
<i>the people of Christophsis
call on the Jedi for assistance.</i>

6
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:33,237
<i>Hoping to save lives
and prevent further destruction,</i>

7
00:00:33,356 --> 00:00:37,477
<i>Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker
plan a daring ambush</i>

8
00:00:37,557 --> 00:00:41,317
<i>which could turn the tide in the fight
for this crucial star system.</i>

9
00:00:41,598 --> 00:00:42,278
Anakin,

10
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:44,438
<i>- how are you doing over there?
- We're set.</i>

11
00:00:44,517 --> 00:00:46,758
I've got some guys here
that are anxious to get going.

12
00:00:46,918 --> 00:00:47,958
<i>Glad to hear it.</i>

13
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:57,799
We're back, General.

14
00:00:58,279 --> 00:01:00,360
Good.
The show is about to begin.

15
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:04,519
How's that cannon coming, boys?

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,241
We'll have this one back in business
in no time, sir.

17
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:12,441
The droids are advancing.

18
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:19,002
I'm seeing a full battalion
coming right on schedule.

19
00:01:20,482 --> 00:01:22,042
Tanks!
They brought tanks.

20
00:01:31,323 --> 00:01:32,523
A little closer.

21
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:37,724
They're splitting up.

22
00:01:38,204 --> 00:01:38,924
What?

23
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:43,325
Something's gone wrong.
Prepare all troops for...

24
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:55,966
Abort the mission!

25
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:02,447
Our position's been compromised.

26
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:08,368
Obi-Wan, what's going on?

27
00:02:09,248 --> 00:02:11,608
We're cut off.
The droids are on to us.

28
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:20,770
Gunship, come in. Hawk,
we need an evac in the south tower.

29
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,090
Roger that, sir. We're coming.

30
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,090
- South tower? We're in the north.
- Not for long.

31
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,851
Rex, fire your cables.

32
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,492
Blast them!

33
00:02:56,294 --> 00:02:58,774
- This way is clear.
- How did you get over here?

34
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:00,134
I improvised.

35
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:19,177
Now what?

36
00:03:57,981 --> 00:04:00,941
Maybe this tactical droid will tell us
how they knew our plan.

37
00:04:08,543 --> 00:04:11,503
<i>The Republic army
is in the north and south towers,</i>

38
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:12,943
<i>level 46.</i>

39
00:04:13,743 --> 00:04:15,184
It just doesn't make sense.

40
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:19,664
Blast!

41
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:23,665
Well, at least we're not the only ones
having a bad day.

42
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:24,785
Generals.

43
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:28,305
They had all our intel.

44
00:04:28,705 --> 00:04:30,305
That would explain the ambush.

45
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:33,345
How could we have left ourselves
so vulnerable to a security breach?

46
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:36,867
- I don't think we did.
- You think someone...

47
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:39,427
- ... infiltrated our defenses?
- Possibly.

48
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,307
It'd have to be someone
cunning and resourceful enough

49
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:44,227
to gain access to all our plans.

50
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:46,707
But that still wouldn't explain
how they got our intel.

51
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:48,707
No, you're right.

52
00:04:49,428 --> 00:04:52,308
They wouldn't act alone. They'd have
someone working with them.

53
00:04:52,628 --> 00:04:53,588
A spy, sir?

54
00:04:54,308 --> 00:04:57,348
But who would want to
betray our troops to the Seppies?

55
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,149
Excellent question, Commander.

56
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:01,749
Perhaps it's time we made a visit
behind enemy lines.

57
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:04,629
- I think we'll find our answers there.
- We'll get right on it.

58
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:07,590
No, Captain. I need you here
to find the security breach.

59
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,630
- You can count on us, sir.
- One more thing.

60
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,031
This mission
is extremely confidential.

61
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:14,791
The spy could be anyone.

62
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,791
Let no one know of our mission.

63
00:05:17,671 --> 00:05:18,952
Understood, sir.

64
00:05:26,072 --> 00:05:27,712
Someone left his com-link on.

65
00:05:28,232 --> 00:05:31,752
Someone has been listening
to everything we said.

66
00:05:33,353 --> 00:05:34,233
Hey! Stop!

67
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:37,513
Who's that?

68
00:05:41,594 --> 00:05:43,675
I'll follow him.
You take the west corridor.

69
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:44,794
I'm on it.

70
00:05:58,556 --> 00:06:00,397
He must have gone in the mess hall.

71
00:06:04,957 --> 00:06:06,637
We've got a big problem.

72
00:06:07,277 --> 00:06:07,997
Yeah.

73
00:06:08,557 --> 00:06:10,958
The only people in here
are brothers.

74
00:06:13,558 --> 00:06:14,518
One of us?

75
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:16,638
Great, but which one?

76
00:06:17,838 --> 00:06:21,079
We'll have to wait for his next move.
Keep this to ourselves.

77
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:22,799
Better contact the Jedi.

78
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:23,879
I'm on it.

79
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:41,842
Don't shoot. Just keep
their communications jammed.

80
00:06:42,121 --> 00:06:43,202
- Roger, roger.
- Roger, roger.

81
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:45,722
We can't reach General Kenobi.

82
00:06:45,842 --> 00:06:48,563
Whoever it is
has blocked our communications.

83
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:51,283
We're gonna have to
find this guy ourselves.

84
00:06:51,803 --> 00:06:53,763
R2, come over here and plug in.

85
00:06:57,643 --> 00:06:58,763
What are you doing?

86
00:06:58,883 --> 00:07:01,323
The guard got his messages
out there somehow.

87
00:07:01,444 --> 00:07:03,604
- We just got to find 'em.
- What do you think?

88
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:06,844
- He just sat down and wrote a note?
- You have to start somewhere.

89
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:13,125
We appear to have picked up
some friends.

90
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:14,166
Indeed.

91
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:17,806
In fact, I believe the number of eyes
watching us has been steadily growing.

92
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:21,607
Great. Perhaps this means our adversary
has learned about our mission.

93
00:07:21,846 --> 00:07:22,847
Perhaps it does.

94
00:07:23,006 --> 00:07:25,327
Of course,
nobody's tried to stop us yet.

95
00:07:25,606 --> 00:07:26,767
Also true.

96
00:07:26,887 --> 00:07:29,087
They want us to get to
the Separatist headquarters,

97
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:30,808
which means this is a trap.

98
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:32,087
I imagine it is.

99
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,568
Well, that's unfortunate.
For them.

100
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:39,849
R2's found something.

101
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:42,409
What is it? Is it the traitor?

102
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:44,369
I'm not sure.

103
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:47,890
- Maybe.
- What is he looking for?

104
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,730
Wavelength interference,
weak frequencies, spotty, irregular.

105
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,050
See how it shows up
every few days...

106
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,811
then disappears?
Day to day, you wouldn't notice it.

107
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,251
- What?
- It's the pattern.

108
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:04,012
The band's only coming
off one terminal in the whole base.

109
00:08:04,412 --> 00:08:05,492
Check it out.

110
00:08:06,491 --> 00:08:07,652
Slick's barracks.

111
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:10,252
Only Slick's men
would have access to that terminal.

112
00:08:11,653 --> 00:08:13,453
Slick's not gonna like that.

113
00:08:13,772 --> 00:08:14,852
No, he's not.

114
00:08:14,973 --> 00:08:17,773
But if one of his men
is giving away our intel,

115
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:19,894
we have to find him
and sort this out.

116
00:08:29,814 --> 00:08:31,655
No guards, no barricades.

117
00:08:32,655 --> 00:08:35,536
You'd think the Separatist headquarters
would be better protected.

118
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:41,776
But clearly, keeping us out
is not what they intend.

119
00:08:47,096 --> 00:08:49,097
No way.
My guys are the best.

120
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:51,858
No way they're capable
of something like this.

121
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:53,458
Something like what?

122
00:08:56,738 --> 00:08:59,058
- You called them here?
- Of course we did.

123
00:08:59,178 --> 00:09:01,619
We're getting to
the bottom of this now.

124
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:04,739
Look, let me have a few minutes
with them first.

125
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:06,739
It's gonna hit them hard.

126
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:09,980
They trust each other,
and if one of our own betrayed us...

127
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,421
I don't think that's necessary.
Your men are tough, right?

128
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,540
Take a seat, gentlemen.

129
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:20,541
We have a turncoat in our midst,

130
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,422
and we think it's one of you.

131
00:09:33,383 --> 00:09:35,503
So this is the belly of the beast.

132
00:09:43,024 --> 00:09:43,944
Ventress.

133
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:46,904
And here I thought this mission
would be unpleasant.

134
00:09:47,264 --> 00:09:50,185
The pleasure's all mine,
my dear Obi-Wan.

135
00:09:51,145 --> 00:09:52,384
I've missed you.

136
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:02,986
I don't know, I was doing the things
I always do after a mission.

137
00:10:03,506 --> 00:10:05,827
- Things like what?
- I'm sorry, sir.

138
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,827
I'm just a little nervous.
You're my C.O.

139
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:10,787
The way I figure it,

140
00:10:10,907 --> 00:10:14,028
you tell the truth,
you got nothing to be nervous about.

141
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:17,188
Jester is telling the truth. He cleans
his weapon after every mission.

142
00:10:17,308 --> 00:10:20,308
First thing, every time.
He's kind of obsessed that way.

143
00:10:20,428 --> 00:10:21,388
Is that right?

144
00:10:21,508 --> 00:10:23,429
- You were cleaning your weapon?
- Yes, sir.

145
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,269
Go on the computer
while you were in here?

146
00:10:25,469 --> 00:10:28,389
No, sir. I didn't even power it up.
You can check.

147
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,950
Show me your weapon.

148
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,550
Yep, freshly scrubbed.

149
00:10:36,111 --> 00:10:38,871
- The rag's over there in the corner.
- Good man.

150
00:10:38,991 --> 00:10:39,791
You.

151
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:43,231
- You were cleaning your weapon too?
- No, I was hungry.

152
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:45,071
I went back to the mess.

153
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:47,151
- Right away?
- Yeah.

154
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:49,552
Anyone with you?

155
00:10:50,672 --> 00:10:51,712
Sketch, sir.

156
00:10:51,832 --> 00:10:55,073
We got to the mess at the same time,
got our grub, and sat together.

157
00:10:55,352 --> 00:10:58,553
Anyone else in the mess able to confirm
what you two are saying?

158
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,713
Lots of guys there.
Ask any of them.

159
00:11:01,313 --> 00:11:03,993
- We will.
- Captain, give me a moment with them.

160
00:11:04,153 --> 00:11:06,234
No, it's okay, Sarge.
I got nothing to hide.

161
00:11:06,354 --> 00:11:07,594
I was in the infirmary.

162
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:10,555
Got banged up pretty good
by one of those clankers.

163
00:11:10,675 --> 00:11:12,355
A med droid was fixing me up.

164
00:11:12,475 --> 00:11:15,516
Doc's got all the records there
if you want to check.

165
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:20,195
So, Chopper, old boy,

166
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:22,916
- what's your alibi?
- I was in the mess hall.

167
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:24,356
No, you weren't!

168
00:11:24,756 --> 00:11:25,996
I mean, you...

169
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,997
If you know something, kid,
you should speak up.

170
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:32,197
Chopper came in a lot later.

171
00:11:32,677 --> 00:11:34,118
After everyone else.

172
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:47,839
My loyal informant let me know
you were coming.

173
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,959
Well, then, we thank you
for your hospitality.

174
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,080
Where were you
before you went to the mess, Chopper?

175
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,121
Nowhere.
Walking around.

176
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:06,081
Son, you know we'll need
a better answer than that.

177
00:12:07,842 --> 00:12:08,881
I was hiding...

178
00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:10,962
at the south exit.

179
00:12:11,722 --> 00:12:13,962
I didn't want anyone to see me
string these together.

180
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:17,483
Battle droid fingers.

181
00:12:19,003 --> 00:12:19,923
I just...

182
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,203
I just wanted something back.

183
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:24,403
I guess I felt like they owed me.

184
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:27,604
I always knew there was something
deficient about you.

185
00:12:30,645 --> 00:12:33,685
This isn't good, Chopper.
Lying about where you were,

186
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:36,325
taking forbidden items
from a battlefield...

187
00:12:37,005 --> 00:12:37,806
I know.

188
00:12:38,005 --> 00:12:40,885
I put up with the attitude
'cause you have skill.

189
00:12:41,086 --> 00:12:44,366
But if you could break these rules,
your whole character's in question here.

190
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:46,047
Wait, no! Hang on.

191
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:47,566
I'm no spy!

192
00:12:57,288 --> 00:12:58,888
Chopper, we're all brothers.

193
00:12:59,008 --> 00:13:01,528
But how can we trust anything
you say now?

194
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:05,128
- No, sir, I'm telling you, I did not...
- It's okay.

195
00:13:05,408 --> 00:13:07,409
We'll get you
a proper investigation.

196
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:10,850
You don't have to say anything
till the Jedi come back and talk to you.

197
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:13,249
Maybe you should talk, sir.
Tell them where you went.

198
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:15,570
I was at the south exit, remember?

199
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:17,690
I saw you go in, sir.
I saw you.

200
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,570
Chopper, I have been patient.

201
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,251
Everyone else turned right
toward the barracks and the mess.

202
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:24,931
You turned left,
toward the command center.

203
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:29,652
- Where were you going, sir?
- Obviously, the kid feels cornered.

204
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:33,332
Sergeant, what did you mean,
"till the Jedi come back"?

205
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:36,052
How did you know
the Jedi were gone?

206
00:13:37,772 --> 00:13:40,493
I really wish
you hadn't noticed that, sir.

207
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:43,774
It's Slick?

208
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:47,494
Slick's the traitor?

209
00:14:08,776 --> 00:14:11,777
- I've got someone by the gunships.
- That's our Slick.

210
00:14:11,897 --> 00:14:14,377
Now that he's exposed,
he has to get out of this base.

211
00:14:15,537 --> 00:14:18,178
There's no escape now,
you piece of rankweed!

212
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:23,979
Move. Move!

213
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,140
He took out our weapons depot.

214
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:41,781
He knew where we'd look.

215
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,741
He's not trying to escape.

216
00:14:43,861 --> 00:14:46,701
He knows all our moves
before we even make 'em.

217
00:14:50,742 --> 00:14:51,902
Give up, Ventress!

218
00:14:52,462 --> 00:14:54,942
I am all yours, Obi-Wan.

219
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,863
You've served your purpose.

220
00:15:06,143 --> 00:15:09,224
- We have to get back. Now!
- It's already too late.

221
00:15:09,504 --> 00:15:12,904
So hard to know
whom to trust these days, isn't it?

222
00:15:13,264 --> 00:15:14,865
What's the plan, Master?

223
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:17,504
Bringing us here was a mistake,
my sweet.

224
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:20,385
You've overestimated your abilities.

225
00:15:20,906 --> 00:15:21,706
Really?

226
00:15:33,547 --> 00:15:35,067
Come and get me, boys!

227
00:15:37,908 --> 00:15:40,348
You didn't tell us
you were bringing friends.

228
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:42,148
Poor Obi-Wan.

229
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:44,148
You've been betrayed.

230
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:47,109
And now we're about
to take control of this world.

231
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,989
- How do we get this guy?
- Sir.

232
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:54,989
Slick ran into the command center.

233
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,750
You guys stay here.
Seal the perimeter.

234
00:16:15,752 --> 00:16:16,632
Anakin!

235
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:27,314
Prepare to march on the city.

236
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:37,035
Have General Loathesome
delay the Jedi as long as possible.

237
00:16:37,234 --> 00:16:40,756
I will need time to execute
the next part of my master's plan.

238
00:16:41,036 --> 00:16:42,195
Yes, Mistress.

239
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,878
Pretend you're Slick.
What's in your head?

240
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:03,078
My cover's blown, it's time to go,

241
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:06,399
but I decide not to use a ship
because it's too obvious.

242
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:13,599
The lockdown.

243
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,799
He wants to get around the lockdown.

244
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:18,160
He's blinded us
by taking out the power.

245
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,400
He could disable
the entire security system.

246
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,081
But he knows we'd expect him
to do that.

247
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:28,361
Or does he?

248
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,042
- Yeah, I see what you're getting at.
- Go to the south exit.

249
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:36,042
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll stay here, get the power back up.

250
00:17:36,162 --> 00:17:37,882
- That'll help.
- Got it.

251
00:17:44,483 --> 00:17:45,883
Hey there, Slick.

252
00:17:46,923 --> 00:17:47,964
Gun's empty.

253
00:17:50,724 --> 00:17:52,724
You know what's funny, traitor?

254
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:56,964
We knew you'd never take a chance
on the exits while they were blocked.

255
00:17:57,604 --> 00:18:00,045
I'd stay here
to open them myself first.

256
00:18:00,605 --> 00:18:01,765
Just like you.

257
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,526
Don't do a job till you've guaranteed
the best odds, right?

258
00:18:06,046 --> 00:18:07,485
You knew I was here.

259
00:18:07,806 --> 00:18:09,166
Of course we knew.

260
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:11,326
You think we wouldn't have a plan?

261
00:18:11,646 --> 00:18:13,087
I'm not the traitor.

262
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:14,606
You are!

263
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:31,329
All of you just blindly
following orders, for what?

264
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:38,570
At least I got something
out of all this suffering.

265
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,690
I bet you sold out your brothers
for some real shiny coin.

266
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:52,371
Yes, she offered me money.

267
00:18:52,852 --> 00:18:54,811
But she offered me
something more important.

268
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:57,492
Something you wouldn't understand.
Freedom!

269
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:05,173
I think freedom's
gonna have to wait, kid.

270
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:08,614
Slick?

271
00:19:09,054 --> 00:19:11,654
- It was you?
- He gave us a bit of a chase, sir.

272
00:19:11,894 --> 00:19:14,014
You couldn't be
a greater disappointment.

273
00:19:14,134 --> 00:19:15,974
How could you do this
to your brothers?

274
00:19:17,174 --> 00:19:18,974
Only a Jedi would ask that.

275
00:19:19,895 --> 00:19:22,535
It's the Jedi
who keep my brothers enslaved.

276
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:24,335
We do your bidding.

277
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,016
We serve at your whim.

278
00:19:26,535 --> 00:19:28,376
I just wanted something more.

279
00:19:28,496 --> 00:19:32,176
And all you had to do to get it
was put the rest of us all at risk.

280
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:35,536
I love my brothers.

281
00:19:36,057 --> 00:19:37,456
You're too blind to see it,

282
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,617
but I was striking the blow
for all clones.

283
00:19:40,017 --> 00:19:43,537
If you loved your brothers,
you wouldn't have put them at risk.

284
00:19:43,978 --> 00:19:45,818
You betrayed everyone of us.

285
00:19:46,938 --> 00:19:48,338
Take him to lockup.

286
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:54,819
Were you able to salvage anything
from the weapons depot?

287
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:57,819
Slick pretty much scorched
the whole thing.

288
00:19:57,939 --> 00:20:00,099
That seemed to be
what he was going for all along.

289
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,260
We managed to save
the heavy cannons, though.

290
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,340
That's good,

291
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,261
'cause there are about
1,000 battle droids on their way here.

292
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,421
The fight goes on, gentlemen.
