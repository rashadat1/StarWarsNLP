1
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:18,420
<i>Planet Ryloth invaded!</i>

2
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,980
<i>Subjected to a brutal
droid occupation,</i>

3
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,659
<i>the people of Ryloth are starving</i>

4
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:24,619
<i>under the blockade
of a Separatist fleet.</i>

5
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:26,939
<i>Evil Separatist leader
Wat Tambor</i>

6
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:29,059
<i>now rules with an iron fist.</i>

7
00:00:29,498 --> 00:00:32,618
<i>Answering a plea from the Senate,
the Grand Army of the Republic</i>

8
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:35,098
<i>mounts a bold offensive
to liberate the system.</i>

9
00:00:35,218 --> 00:00:37,737
<i>It is up to Anakin Skywalker
and his padawan Ahsoka</i>

10
00:00:38,097 --> 00:00:40,408
<i>to make way
for Obi-Wan's ground assault.</i>

11
00:00:44,256 --> 00:00:45,975
<i>Captain, are you prepared?</i>

12
00:00:46,576 --> 00:00:48,895
Our blockade is impenetrable.

13
00:00:49,335 --> 00:00:51,175
When the Republic attacks,

14
00:00:51,615 --> 00:00:54,374
they will get quite a surprise.

15
00:00:55,134 --> 00:00:57,014
<i>I'm counting on you, Captain.</i>

16
00:00:57,414 --> 00:01:00,533
<i>We cannot allow the Republic
to invade this planet.</i>

17
00:01:10,698 --> 00:01:12,424
Sir,
we're coming out of hyperspace.

18
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:14,631
Prepare for battle.
Raise the shields.

19
00:01:17,804 --> 00:01:19,565
<i>All ships, prepare for launch.</i>

20
00:01:20,925 --> 00:01:22,844
<i>All ships, prepare for launch.</i>

21
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,939
This is my first time
commanding a squadron, R7.

22
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,499
Let's make a good impression.

23
00:01:30,513 --> 00:01:32,239
Of course I'm not nervous.

24
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,870
Hey, Snips.
This is it.

25
00:01:34,063 --> 00:01:36,364
Your first command.
Don't be nervous.

26
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:38,475
I wish everyone would
stop saying that.

27
00:01:38,668 --> 00:01:41,736
The men you're commanding
are depending on you with their lives.

28
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:44,038
Thanks.
That takes the pressure off.

29
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:46,436
If I wasn't nervous before,
I sure am now.

30
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:48,547
Hey, I have faith in you.

31
00:01:48,836 --> 00:01:51,233
I wouldn't send you out there
if I didn't think you could handle it.

32
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:54,110
May the Force be with you.

33
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:55,837
I won't let you down...

34
00:01:56,222 --> 00:01:57,372
I hope.

35
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,601
OK, you boys ready?

36
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,881
This is Two Ax.
Ready when you are, skipper.

37
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,241
Ready on three.
This is Slava. Over.

38
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,320
Ready on four.
Kicked back, checking in.

39
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,520
Soup to Blue leader.
Group Two is standing by. Over.

40
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,519
Taco on five.
Waiting for mother bird. Over.

41
00:02:36,478 --> 00:02:38,588
- Commander.
- Yes, Captain?

42
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:40,215
Launch all fighters.

43
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:41,735
Roger, roger.

44
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:56,635
- Tell Ahsoka the fleet is ready.
- Commander, you're all clear.

45
00:02:56,795 --> 00:02:57,716
Thank you, Admiral.

46
00:02:57,908 --> 00:03:00,401
Keep the cruisers back
until we've softened them up.

47
00:03:00,498 --> 00:03:03,375
Well, R7,
are you ready for some action?

48
00:03:05,006 --> 00:03:08,074
Ax, keep your squadron back
and wait for my signal.

49
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:09,226
You got it, boss.

50
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:13,917
Here we go.

51
00:03:20,054 --> 00:03:21,972
All right, boys,
let's clear a path.

52
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:23,124
Right away, sir.

53
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:26,385
Pick your targets.

54
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:37,066
<i>- Clear!
- I'm on it.</i>

55
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,697
<i>- Nice work!
- Two new targets closing!</i>

56
00:03:41,297 --> 00:03:44,617
That is General Skywalker's
flagship.

57
00:03:45,297 --> 00:03:47,296
He is leading this attack.

58
00:03:47,776 --> 00:03:50,736
- Sir, their fighters are closing fast.
- Patience.

59
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:55,455
Let's see what trickery
the Jedi have planned for us.

60
00:03:59,854 --> 00:04:01,734
We've got their fighters occupied.

61
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:04,933
Ax, time for us to make a run
for the battleship.

62
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:09,212
Come on, you whiners.
Let's get dirty!

63
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:19,225
Sir, a squadron of fighters
are attacking.

64
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:21,505
They have a clear path right to us.

65
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:24,545
Now is the time to bring in
our reinforcements.

66
00:04:25,544 --> 00:04:28,384
- Battlecruiser 17.
- Battlecruiser 19,

67
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:29,864
attack position!

68
00:04:34,103 --> 00:04:36,982
Admiral, four more enemy cruisers
have joined the blockade.

69
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:38,862
We've got to warn those fighters.

70
00:04:39,022 --> 00:04:40,982
<i>Commander,
we've been caught in a trap!</i>

71
00:04:41,102 --> 00:04:44,101
You're overreacting, Admiral.
I can get us through.

72
00:04:44,221 --> 00:04:46,021
Blue Squadron, stay the course.

73
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:47,581
We're all set, Blue Leader.

74
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,220
I'm ordering you to return to the ship.
We're going to need your help.

75
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:52,940
Ahsoka, it's too risky.

76
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:55,059
<i>Get your pilots out of there.</i>

77
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:57,338
Sir, we've got their fighters
surrounded.

78
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:58,554
Good.

79
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:00,258
She's not turning around.

80
00:05:00,355 --> 00:05:02,752
Did you train her
not to follow orders?

81
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,830
Ax, are you still there?

82
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:09,995
Come on, boys.
Stay in formation.

83
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:12,275
Got two on my tail.
I can't shake 'em!

84
00:05:14,354 --> 00:05:16,274
I can't help you, Ax,
I've got my own problem.

85
00:05:20,878 --> 00:05:23,745
We're far too outnumbered!
They're breaking our lines.

86
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:26,871
Ahsoka, we are in trouble.
I order you back here.

87
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:28,310
All right, all right.

88
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,909
Let's go, squad.
Pull back to the command ship.

89
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,509
- Why are we retreating?
- We're not retreating. We're following orders

90
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:49,986
Intensify deflector shields.

91
00:05:50,187 --> 00:05:52,306
They're too many.
We can't shoot them all down!

92
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:54,345
Fighter squadron, where are you?

93
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:57,304
Cool your jets, Admiral.
We're almost there.

94
00:05:57,401 --> 00:05:58,264
It's too late!

95
00:05:58,567 --> 00:05:59,567
Run for it!

96
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,285
Admiral, come in.
Admiral!

97
00:06:07,606 --> 00:06:10,085
- Hang on, Admiral.
- Get us out of here.

98
00:06:10,645 --> 00:06:13,324
Get those fighters onboard
and prepare for lightspeed.

99
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:24,083
<i>All fighters, return!
We're preparing for lightspeed.</i>

100
00:06:24,523 --> 00:06:26,522
Right.
Ax, stand on it!

101
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:29,162
We only have a few seconds
to get onboard.

102
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,001
Don't worry about me, skipper.

103
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:34,681
Captain, the Republic space forces
are in retreat.

104
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:36,041
Shall we pursue?

105
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,680
No.
Do not break our formation.

106
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,880
Let those cowards run.

107
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,400
My power converters,
they're failing!

108
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,080
Just stay with me, Ax.

109
00:06:54,078 --> 00:06:55,037
Overload!

110
00:06:58,437 --> 00:06:59,237
Ax!

111
00:07:03,196 --> 00:07:05,556
Close up the hangar doors.
We're home.

112
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:17,594
Jump to lightspeed.

113
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,552
Get your squad together.
I need a head count.

114
00:07:26,752 --> 00:07:29,072
I need to know
how many we lost today.

115
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:36,271
Ahsoka,
I am very disappointed in you.

116
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,670
You not only disobeyed the admiral,
you disobeyed me.

117
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,470
I thought I could
knock out those battleships

118
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,350
so when Master Obi-Wan arrived,
he could get through.

119
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,549
I know you meant well, Snips,

120
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:49,508
but there's a bigger picture
that you're not aware of.

121
00:07:49,628 --> 00:07:52,868
First rule of war:
Listen and obey your superiors.

122
00:07:53,027 --> 00:07:55,147
But sometimes
you get carried away.

123
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:58,627
All that means is that I understand
what you're going through.

124
00:07:58,747 --> 00:08:01,146
- But I failed.
- It was a trap, Snips.

125
00:08:01,586 --> 00:08:02,866
It wasn't your fault.

126
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,426
I lost so many of my pilots.

127
00:08:06,146 --> 00:08:07,705
Take heart, little one.

128
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,825
That's the reality of command.

129
00:08:11,465 --> 00:08:13,425
General, we're approaching
our staging area.

130
00:08:13,544 --> 00:08:14,704
Very good, Captain.

131
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:17,224
Master Windu is requesting
a report on our progress.

132
00:08:17,343 --> 00:08:18,423
Our progress, huh?

133
00:08:18,663 --> 00:08:21,303
- We haven't made any progress yet.
- I'll tell him, sir.

134
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:23,583
No, Rex.
I'll tell him myself, thank you.

135
00:08:23,863 --> 00:08:26,422
As soon as we tend to our wounded,
get me a damage report.

136
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:27,622
Right away, sir.

137
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:29,821
Snips, I'm gonna need you to...

138
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,420
<i>Captain, what is the status
of the enemy attack?</i>

139
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,420
The Jedi were crushed, of course.

140
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:43,340
They fled the system,
their ships in flames.

141
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:47,299
I assure you, Admiral,
our blockade is very much intact.

142
00:08:48,058 --> 00:08:50,498
<i>Congratulations
are in order, Captain.</i>

143
00:08:50,778 --> 00:08:52,857
<i>But do not underestimate the Jedi.</i>

144
00:08:54,257 --> 00:08:55,297
Commander,

145
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:58,336
bring me the archive data
on General Skywalker.

146
00:08:58,456 --> 00:09:00,656
I need to learn more
about our opponent.

147
00:09:00,776 --> 00:09:01,776
Roger, roger.

148
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,135
They caught us by surprise, Master.

149
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:09,414
<i>- We were outnumbered.
- How many men did you lose?</i>

150
00:09:09,854 --> 00:09:11,734
We lost a cruiser, the Redeemer,

151
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:14,374
plus an entire squadron of fighters.

152
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:16,494
<i>And your padawan?</i>

153
00:09:16,693 --> 00:09:20,252
No, Ahsoka is fine.
She's just recovering from the battle.

154
00:09:20,372 --> 00:09:23,172
Losing her squadron
was hard to take.

155
00:09:23,373 --> 00:09:25,492
<i>Give her time.
But, Anakin,</i>

156
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:28,211
<i>you will need her help
if you're going to get through this.</i>

157
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:29,291
I know.

158
00:09:29,412 --> 00:09:31,811
<i>Your forces have been
cut in half, Skywalker.</i>

159
00:09:32,091 --> 00:09:35,650
<i>If you can't break that blockade
before the next planetary rotation,</i>

160
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,450
<i>we will have to postpone the invasion.</i>

161
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,810
The Twi'leks on that planet
can't wait forever, Master.

162
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,649
The longer the Techno Union
keeps control of Ryloth,

163
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:44,928
the more difficult it'll be
to free them.

164
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:47,728
<i>I agree.
We don't have much time.</i>

165
00:09:50,687 --> 00:09:52,687
Rex,
see if you can find Ahsoka.

166
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:58,286
He is stable for now.

167
00:10:02,406 --> 00:10:05,685
Admiral, I am so sorry.

168
00:10:07,605 --> 00:10:09,244
They're all gone.

169
00:10:11,204 --> 00:10:14,163
Commander Ahsoka,
General Skywalker is looking for you.

170
00:10:20,042 --> 00:10:21,442
No, R2, the other one.

171
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,001
Yeah, that's it.

172
00:10:25,002 --> 00:10:26,122
This'll do it.

173
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:29,401
You wanted to see me, Master?

174
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,720
Ahsoka.

175
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:32,721
Hand me that socket plug.

176
00:10:34,281 --> 00:10:35,240
Here.

177
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:37,759
Thanks, Snips.

178
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,399
How are you feeling?

179
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:42,518
Oh, I'm fine, Master.
Just fine.

180
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,438
That's good to hear.

181
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,238
I'm gonna need you level-headed
if we're gonna pull this thing off.

182
00:10:47,398 --> 00:10:49,158
"Pull this off"?
Pull what off?

183
00:10:50,428 --> 00:10:52,028
I talked to Master Windu.

184
00:10:52,148 --> 00:10:54,628
We're to proceed
with our attack on the blockade.

185
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:55,747
What?!

186
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:57,707
We can't!

187
00:10:58,547 --> 00:11:01,146
Ahsoka,
we have to break that blockade.

188
00:11:01,546 --> 00:11:03,746
The Twi'leks on Ryloth
are depending on us.

189
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:07,745
I understand that, Master,
but we've lost so many men.

190
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:10,025
- Did we get more support?
- No.

191
00:11:10,145 --> 00:11:12,585
We have to make do
with the forces we have.

192
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:16,264
- And I need to come up with a plan.
- You don't even have a plan?!

193
00:11:16,704 --> 00:11:18,223
Don't worry, Ahsoka.

194
00:11:18,703 --> 00:11:19,424
No!

195
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:22,863
That's what you said last time,
and now everyone's gone!

196
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:24,742
- My whole squadron!
- Ahsoka!

197
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:27,142
We can't just smash through
that blockade.

198
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:33,981
Skywalker here.

199
00:11:34,101 --> 00:11:35,861
<i>General,
the Defender is contacting us.</i>

200
00:11:36,141 --> 00:11:37,500
<i>There seems to be a problem.</i>

201
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,740
All right, Rex,
I'll be right there.

202
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,963
Go back to your quarters and cool off!
We'll finish this talk later.

203
00:11:54,857 --> 00:11:57,097
Not a conventional Jedi,

204
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,017
to say the least,
it would seem.

205
00:12:00,976 --> 00:12:03,016
- Commander!
- Yes, Captain?

206
00:12:03,136 --> 00:12:07,575
Prepare all cannons and send
the droids to their battle stations.

207
00:12:07,655 --> 00:12:08,735
Yes, sir.

208
00:12:09,735 --> 00:12:12,054
Captain, are we under attack?

209
00:12:12,454 --> 00:12:16,813
No, but if Skywalker's record
indicates anything,

210
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,013
he'll be back.

211
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,371
Trooper, what's going on?

212
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:30,212
The starship Defender
is being evacuated, sir.

213
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:32,211
Evacuated?
Why?

214
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:33,491
I'm not sure.

215
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,770
We're on our way
to help General Skywalker in the hangar.

216
00:12:44,488 --> 00:12:47,128
All right, men, this way.
Come on, move it.

217
00:12:47,448 --> 00:12:49,768
Move it! Let's go!
No time to waste!

218
00:12:49,928 --> 00:12:52,767
Master, I'm almost afraid to ask.

219
00:12:52,927 --> 00:12:55,927
- I ordered the Defender evacuated.
- I can see that.

220
00:12:56,127 --> 00:12:57,126
Why?

221
00:12:57,286 --> 00:12:59,726
Well, actually,
I got the idea from you.

222
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,926
Oh, great.

223
00:13:02,086 --> 00:13:03,605
Rex, take over, will you?

224
00:13:03,725 --> 00:13:06,125
You said we couldn't
just smash through the blockade.

225
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,285
I decided that's partly true.

226
00:13:08,405 --> 00:13:11,284
You also implied that my plans
put a lot of people at risk...

227
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:14,444
- and I agree with you on that one.
- That's a first.

228
00:13:14,484 --> 00:13:16,564
I decided the only way
we can break the blockade

229
00:13:16,684 --> 00:13:20,483
is if I pilot the Defender right into their
battleship and take out the commander.

230
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,922
- What?!
- This way I'm the only one at risk.

231
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:26,481
Besides, the Defender
is damaged already.

232
00:13:26,642 --> 00:13:29,161
You can't be serious, Master.

233
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:31,281
- You'll die!
- No, I won't.

234
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,561
That's where you come in.

235
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,440
The enemy can't stop that ship
from taking them out.

236
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,640
R2 and I will get in an escape pod
and jettison right before impact.

237
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:41,559
But the enemy fleet is right there!

238
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:45,759
I know, and I'll pretty much be
defenseless in an escape pod,

239
00:13:45,878 --> 00:13:49,118
so I'm depending on you
to engage the remaining fleet

240
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:50,798
with the combined forces
we have here.

241
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,197
Master, I...

242
00:13:53,477 --> 00:13:54,477
I can't.

243
00:13:54,597 --> 00:13:57,996
If something goes wrong...
I can't be responsible for...

244
00:13:58,076 --> 00:14:00,356
You are responsible, Ahsoka.

245
00:14:00,475 --> 00:14:04,315
These men are depending on you,
and this time so am I.

246
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:06,595
But, Master, last time I...

247
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,314
Attention! Everyone!

248
00:14:08,554 --> 00:14:09,674
Attention!

249
00:14:10,154 --> 00:14:11,914
All right, men,
listen up.

250
00:14:12,034 --> 00:14:15,553
I'm taking over the Defender, and I'm
leaving Commander Ahsoka in charge.

251
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:17,273
She'll lead the second half
of the mission

252
00:14:17,393 --> 00:14:19,793
when we engage
what's remaining of the blockade.

253
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,999
Try to leave some ships for us,
General.

254
00:14:22,384 --> 00:14:23,247
Will do, Rex.

255
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:26,427
Now, Commander Ahsoka will
fill you in on the full plan.

256
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,467
- Master, wait!
- Good luck.

257
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:29,491
Master!

258
00:14:29,971 --> 00:14:31,811
Awaiting orders, Commander.

259
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,250
I'll be on the bridge.

260
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:39,089
Well, you heard her, boys.
Back to work!

261
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:40,929
Come on!
Move it! Move it!

262
00:14:50,928 --> 00:14:53,047
- Commander on deck.
- At ease.

263
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,686
General Skywalker is contacting you.

264
00:14:58,286 --> 00:15:00,806
<i>All right, Ahsoka,
we're ready to get under way.</i>

265
00:15:00,926 --> 00:15:01,845
Master,

266
00:15:02,006 --> 00:15:04,165
are you sure
you won't reconsider this?

267
00:15:04,325 --> 00:15:06,405
<i>This is the only way,
trust me.</i>

268
00:15:09,564 --> 00:15:11,244
Better fill us in, Commander.

269
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,043
Right.

270
00:15:17,363 --> 00:15:19,003
<i>Count Dooku has assured me</i>

271
00:15:19,122 --> 00:15:22,202
<i>the Republic forces
are stretched thin in our sector.</i>

272
00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:25,642
<i>They should be unable
to mount a counterattack.</i>

273
00:15:25,922 --> 00:15:28,561
<i>Any attempt to do so
would be suicide.</i>

274
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:33,000
Still, I am certain
this Skywalker will return.

275
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:35,360
His ultimate defeat

276
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,319
shall be my greatest victory.

277
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,119
<i>You admire Skywalker?</i>

278
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,118
As a general, yes.

279
00:15:43,638 --> 00:15:46,358
His record shows
he is a great warrior.

280
00:15:46,638 --> 00:15:49,598
And I want him to know
it is I...

281
00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:51,677
...who has beaten him.

282
00:15:53,796 --> 00:15:56,196
I have to say
this plan is questionable.

283
00:15:56,357 --> 00:15:59,476
Yeah, but with their general destroyed
along with their battleship,

284
00:15:59,596 --> 00:16:01,755
the droid commanders
will be in chaos.

285
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,155
Only temporarily.

286
00:16:03,315 --> 00:16:05,994
And there's still General Skywalker
to find in all that mess.

287
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:07,234
I know, but...

288
00:16:07,315 --> 00:16:10,554
In our first attack we had three
fully armed cruisers, and we failed.

289
00:16:10,674 --> 00:16:13,794
I wish General Skywalker
had discussed this plan with us.

290
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,353
The odds are very much against us.

291
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:17,873
They always are.

292
00:16:18,232 --> 00:16:21,272
Yes, but normally we have
General Skywalker to lead us, and...

293
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:25,312
I meant no offense, Commander.

294
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:26,791
None taken.

295
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,429
Sir, an enemy ship
is emerging from hyperspace.

296
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,029
I knew he'd return.

297
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:44,628
There is
an incoming transmission, sir.

298
00:16:45,748 --> 00:16:46,948
Put it through.

299
00:16:49,347 --> 00:16:50,587
<i>Greetings, Captain.</i>

300
00:16:50,707 --> 00:16:53,306
<i>I'm Anakin Skywalker,
general of the Grand Army of the...</i>

301
00:16:53,466 --> 00:16:56,346
I know who you are, Skywalker.

302
00:16:56,986 --> 00:16:59,065
<i>Well, my reputation precedes me, then.</i>

303
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,905
<i>I've been ordered
to surrender myself,</i>

304
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:03,185
<i>the entire crew of this vessel
and my ship</i>

305
00:17:03,304 --> 00:17:05,625
<i>in exchange for safe passage of food</i>

306
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,264
<i>and medical supplies
to the people of Ryloth.</i>

307
00:17:08,424 --> 00:17:10,463
A noble gesture, Jedi.

308
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:12,583
And your capture

309
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,782
would make me
the envy of the Separatist fleet.

310
00:17:17,022 --> 00:17:21,022
Sir, even if Skywalker is successful
and destroys the battleship,

311
00:17:21,421 --> 00:17:25,261
how will we stand up to the combined
firepower of the remaining frigates?

312
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:30,420
I thought about that
and, well, I have an idea.

313
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,980
Go ahead, Commander.

314
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,299
If we took the Resolute and angled
her hull against the incoming frigates,

315
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:40,299
the bridge and hangar deck would be
relatively safe from their attack.

316
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:44,018
We could draw them in and then
use the bombers to outflank them.

317
00:17:44,138 --> 00:17:47,257
The bombers would be too fast,
and they would be trapped.

318
00:17:47,418 --> 00:17:48,937
I'm not sure about this, Commander.

319
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:50,057
I think...

320
00:17:50,216 --> 00:17:52,657
If we were certain
the shields would hold...

321
00:17:52,816 --> 00:17:56,176
Perhaps a different strategy.
We need to take more time and plan.

322
00:17:56,736 --> 00:17:59,695
No!
We don't have any more time!

323
00:18:00,056 --> 00:18:02,414
Master Skywalker needs me now!

324
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,814
He needs us now.

325
00:18:05,494 --> 00:18:07,094
The commander is right.

326
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:10,253
I know this strategy is very bold,

327
00:18:10,653 --> 00:18:13,613
but these circumstances
call for drastic measures.

328
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,852
Then, the strategy will work, sir?

329
00:18:16,253 --> 00:18:17,932
Well, will it?

330
00:18:19,212 --> 00:18:20,971
Yes, it will.

331
00:18:24,891 --> 00:18:27,570
We have completed the scan
of the enemy ship.

332
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,650
And?

333
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,730
The ship is heavily damaged.

334
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,329
All power is diverted
to the forward shields.

335
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:35,409
There is only one life-form onboard.

336
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:37,769
- What?!
- The ship is heavily damaged.

337
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:40,448
- All power is...
- No, you insolent scrub!

338
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:43,328
Skywalker, what treachery is this?

339
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:45,767
You have nothing to bargain with.

340
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:48,167
<i>In that case, I'll be going.</i>

341
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:50,647
<i>You can still have my ship.</i>

342
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:52,846
Uh, sir...

343
00:18:52,926 --> 00:18:55,886
there's a second Republic ship
entering the system.

344
00:18:56,445 --> 00:18:57,325
She made it!

345
00:18:57,445 --> 00:18:59,949
Boost the engines
and let's get outta here.

346
00:19:07,044 --> 00:19:09,203
When those two ships collide,
there'll be chaos.

347
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:10,403
We need that time

348
00:19:10,523 --> 00:19:13,283
to get General Skywalker's pod
into the tractor beam.

349
00:19:13,643 --> 00:19:14,962
Right, Commander.

350
00:19:16,162 --> 00:19:17,642
I'll man the fighter squadron.

351
00:19:17,762 --> 00:19:19,761
Wait for my signal
to begin our attack.

352
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:20,881
Yes, sir.

353
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:26,120
All cannons, fire!
Fire!

354
00:19:39,118 --> 00:19:40,518
We can't stop it!

355
00:19:40,678 --> 00:19:44,398
- What should we do?
- You stay here. I'll be back.

356
00:19:44,838 --> 00:19:45,917
That's great.

357
00:19:53,036 --> 00:19:54,764
See, I told you
it would work.

358
00:19:54,924 --> 00:19:57,835
<i>Sky guy, we're approaching your position.
Stand by for retrieval.</i>

359
00:19:57,955 --> 00:19:59,195
Right on time, Ahsoka.

360
00:20:08,632 --> 00:20:10,752
I don't think
they're going to attack, Commander.

361
00:20:10,912 --> 00:20:13,312
<i>- We'll have to retreat.
- No! Wait!</i>

362
00:20:13,656 --> 00:20:15,736
Remember, they are droids.

363
00:20:15,935 --> 00:20:17,495
They're just a little slow.

364
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:19,214
They'll figure it out.

365
00:20:19,934 --> 00:20:21,775
I think the captain left.

366
00:20:22,294 --> 00:20:24,853
<i>- Who's in charge?
- Not me.</i>

367
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:28,493
<i>- What should we do?
- Begin attack.</i>

368
00:20:37,572 --> 00:20:39,131
The droids are attacking, sir.

369
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:42,091
Commander, on your order,
commence flanking manoeuvre.

370
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,291
OK, boys, here we go.

371
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:45,651
Follow my lead.

372
00:21:01,808 --> 00:21:04,207
<i>- We've been outflanked!
- Affirmative!</i>

373
00:21:05,975 --> 00:21:07,447
That-a-girl, Ahsoka.

374
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,005
<i>Where is the captain?
What is going on?</i>

375
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:20,124
He's in an escape pod.

376
00:21:20,365 --> 00:21:22,844
<i>Idiots!
The blockade has been broken!</i>

377
00:21:24,404 --> 00:21:26,283
Where are those escape pods?

378
00:21:28,563 --> 00:21:31,242
<i>Commander, the invasion fleet
is coming out of hyperspace.</i>

379
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:35,082
Ahsoka, this is Obi-Wan.

380
00:21:35,242 --> 00:21:36,721
May we begin our landing?

381
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,681
Yes, Master.
You're cleared for ground assault.

382
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,480
I won't even ask
where the rest of Anakin's fleet is,

383
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,080
or why he's in an escape pod.

384
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,720
That's probably for the best.

385
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,599
Rex, that reminds me,

386
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,079
send a shuttle
to pick up Master Skywalker.

387
00:22:05,077 --> 00:22:06,957
<i>General, are you still there?</i>

388
00:22:07,436 --> 00:22:10,116
Yep. I'm just sitting here
watching the show.
