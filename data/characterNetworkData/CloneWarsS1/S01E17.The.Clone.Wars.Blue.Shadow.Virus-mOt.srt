1
00:00:17,168 --> 00:00:19,248
<i>Battle droids on Naboo!</i>

2
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:22,927
<i>As the Separatist rebellion
rages through the galaxy,</i>

3
00:00:23,047 --> 00:00:25,326
<i>even peaceful planets
are threatened.</i>

4
00:00:25,806 --> 00:00:29,684
<i>Following the discovery of Separatist
droids wandering the grassy wasteland,</i>

5
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:31,884
<i>Naboo is once again on high alert.</i>

6
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:35,203
<i>Fearing their home
is facing another invasion,</i>

7
00:00:35,323 --> 00:00:37,643
<i>Senator Amidala
and Representative Binks</i>

8
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:40,243
<i>race to Naboo
to assess the situation.</i>

9
00:00:40,722 --> 00:00:43,642
<i>Meanwhile,
near the Gungan swamplands,</i>

10
00:00:43,762 --> 00:00:47,161
<i>an even graver threat
is about to be discovered.</i>

11
00:01:01,598 --> 00:01:04,837
We came as soon as we could, my Lady.
Have you found any more droids?

12
00:01:05,317 --> 00:01:08,596
Only the three. But you can be sure
they aren't tourists.

13
00:01:08,756 --> 00:01:11,356
I need you to convince the Senate
or the Jedi Council

14
00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:14,595
or whoever is in charge of this terrible war
that we are threatened.

15
00:01:15,035 --> 00:01:16,514
They'll need more proof.

16
00:01:16,634 --> 00:01:19,274
Finding a couple of battle droids
will not be enough.

17
00:01:19,393 --> 00:01:22,512
<i>Captain Typho,
the battle droid is ready for analysis.</i>

18
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:30,231
Have you been able to
retrieve any information?

19
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:33,110
Unfortunately,
the Naboo security who discovered them

20
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,750
prefer to shoot first
and retrieve data later.

21
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,749
If they were found
in the grasslands,

22
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:40,429
where'd they pick up all this mud?

23
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:42,908
Add that
to our very long list of questions.

24
00:01:43,868 --> 00:01:44,948
Yummy-yummy.

25
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:52,626
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
With your permission, Senator Padme,

26
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:56,265
I would like to shut down
before I get sensory overload.

27
00:01:56,385 --> 00:01:58,304
- Permission denied.
- Denied?

28
00:01:58,544 --> 00:02:01,743
3PO, you may be able to
get some information out of him.

29
00:02:02,543 --> 00:02:03,903
Cannot see.

30
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:05,542
Where am I?

31
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,662
You are in very good hands
on board a Separatist ship.

32
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:16,820
Count Dooku himself intends
to reward you for your bravery.

33
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,740
- Bravery?
- For your assignment on Naboo.

34
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,499
Do try to activate
what's left of your memory.

35
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:25,419
We all want to hear
your tale of medical heroics.

36
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:27,937
Virus.

37
00:02:29,177 --> 00:02:30,417
Yes, the virus.

38
00:02:30,737 --> 00:02:32,736
You do remember. Please continue.

39
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:43,694
A small amount leaked out.

40
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,493
Must contain.

41
00:02:45,814 --> 00:02:46,973
Naboo cannot know.

42
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:57,971
Lab must remain secret.

43
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:00,930
A secret lab on Naboo?
Where? You must...

44
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,329
It is a secret.

45
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,849
This is no Separatist ship.

46
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:09,248
Unless you want to become
a box of spare parts,

47
00:03:09,368 --> 00:03:11,448
you'll tell us where that lab is.

48
00:03:13,647 --> 00:03:15,926
- The lab is secret.
- Look out.

49
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:23,765
We'll never get any information
out of him now.

50
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:26,844
Meesa sorry.

51
00:03:27,484 --> 00:03:28,724
It was an accident.

52
00:03:32,523 --> 00:03:35,242
Is this what you're after?

53
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:36,202
Meesa love him.

54
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:39,601
He's a very, very good
tongue grabbing.

55
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:42,080
Yousa finden in one placen.

56
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,360
Where?

57
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,600
In the mud under the perlote tree.

58
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,599
Like the mud on this droid.

59
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,679
The eastern swamps.

60
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,966
I think Jar Jar just found out
the location of that lab.

61
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,397
They're planning an attack on Naboo.
It's the only explanation.

62
00:03:57,797 --> 00:03:59,796
<i>Delicate, the situation is.</i>

63
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:01,836
<i>Two Jedi, we will send.</i>

64
00:04:02,196 --> 00:04:05,875
May I recommend General Kenobi
and General Skywalker?

65
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,474
Relations with the Gungans
are a little tense right now,

66
00:04:08,594 --> 00:04:10,714
but they trust General Kenobi
like one of their own.

67
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:13,474
<i>Send them, we will.</i>

68
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:17,192
I want as much information
as possible before the Jedi arrive.

69
00:04:17,352 --> 00:04:20,511
See if you and 3PO can download
any of the other battle droids' memory.

70
00:04:20,631 --> 00:04:21,952
I'm going to find that lab.

71
00:04:23,031 --> 00:04:24,431
Are you sure that's wise?

72
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,550
Come on, Jar Jar.

73
00:04:43,186 --> 00:04:44,066
Back!

74
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:46,586
That water gone poodoo.

75
00:04:48,465 --> 00:04:49,705
This is muy bad.

76
00:05:18,938 --> 00:05:20,417
This is bombad.

77
00:05:20,977 --> 00:05:23,577
- Whatsa happen to them?
- It's the plague.

78
00:05:25,337 --> 00:05:26,936
We're definitely getting close.

79
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:35,014
- Whosa are you?
- What you doing?

80
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,334
Why yousa here?

81
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:40,333
Whatsa yousa thinkin'?

82
00:05:41,213 --> 00:05:43,533
Don't move.
I don't want to hurt you.

83
00:05:43,932 --> 00:05:45,652
Jar Jar, put your helmet back on.

84
00:05:50,691 --> 00:05:54,770
Yousa okeyday. It's not in the air,
it's in the water.

85
00:05:58,209 --> 00:05:59,368
Who are you?

86
00:05:59,488 --> 00:06:01,208
Meesa Peppi Bow.

87
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,528
We think the virus
that made your animals sick

88
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:05,007
came from the perlote trees.

89
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:09,126
Yousa follow thisa river,
yousa finda yousa perlote.

90
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:11,326
Meesa take you.

91
00:06:11,686 --> 00:06:13,925
No, Peppi, you stay here.

92
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:16,525
You'll be going home soon,
I promise.

93
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:20,324
I'll send some soldiers to pick you up
and take you back to Theed.

94
00:06:25,203 --> 00:06:26,603
Keep your eyes open.

95
00:06:26,723 --> 00:06:29,082
Look for anything
out of the ordinary.

96
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,047
I suppose one can never have
too many lab rats.

97
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,679
Please, escort our guests inside.

98
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,199
Roger, roger.

99
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:52,436
A hatch.

100
00:06:53,436 --> 00:06:56,916
Captain Typho, I think we're standing
right on top of the lab.

101
00:06:57,036 --> 00:07:00,114
I need a geo scan
of coordinates SP127.

102
00:07:03,954 --> 00:07:05,993
No way we're going to open this.

103
00:07:09,793 --> 00:07:11,592
- We'll just have to...
- Freeze!

104
00:07:11,712 --> 00:07:13,151
Hold it right there.

105
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:17,551
Yousa let us go.

106
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,830
Who are you?
Why are you holding us?

107
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:28,428
Wonderful specimens.

108
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,107
What's a life-form like you

109
00:07:32,187 --> 00:07:34,347
doing in a swamp like this?

110
00:07:35,226 --> 00:07:37,146
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

111
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:40,745
Thanks to the support
of my compassionate friends

112
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:42,985
in the Separatist Alliance,

113
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:46,344
I am creating life.

114
00:07:47,064 --> 00:07:48,584
Howsa yousa creating life?

115
00:07:49,144 --> 00:07:50,983
I'm so pleased you inquired.

116
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:53,383
A demonstration is in order.

117
00:07:54,022 --> 00:07:55,542
Allow me to present

118
00:07:55,702 --> 00:07:58,421
the return of the infamous

119
00:07:58,502 --> 00:08:01,061
Blue Shadow virus.

120
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:02,980
The Blue Shadow virus?

121
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,860
I thought that deadly disease
was extinct.

122
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,619
Yes, it was wiped from the galaxy
generations ago,

123
00:08:09,778 --> 00:08:13,298
but I have given it life once again.

124
00:08:14,498 --> 00:08:17,297
Yousa not creating life.
Yousa taking life.

125
00:08:17,617 --> 00:08:19,376
Yousa poisoned the Gungan water.

126
00:08:23,615 --> 00:08:25,375
Unfortunately,

127
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,495
the Blue Shadow virus,
in its natural form,

128
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:30,494
thrives only in water

129
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:34,653
until I improved upon that weakness.

130
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:46,491
Your eyes do not deceive you.

131
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,529
I have perfected an airborne strain

132
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:52,408
of the Blue Shadow virus.

133
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:55,608
This is the last of the bombs,
doctor.

134
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:59,047
I'm well aware this is the last.
You think I'd lose count?

135
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:02,087
The virus in its gaseous forms

136
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,926
combined with these bombs

137
00:09:04,006 --> 00:09:06,166
will release the Blue Shadow virus

138
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:08,085
back into the galaxy,

139
00:09:09,045 --> 00:09:11,445
more potent than ever before.

140
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,924
Are you insane?

141
00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:14,404
It's a deadly disease.

142
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:16,364
No life-forms are immune to it.

143
00:09:16,483 --> 00:09:18,003
That's why it was eradicated.

144
00:09:18,523 --> 00:09:20,203
You mean murdered.

145
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:22,322
Take this away.

146
00:09:23,482 --> 00:09:25,841
Meanwhile, as we speak,

147
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:28,080
thousands and thousands
of so-called

148
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,841
superior life-forms

149
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,039
are spreading their disease of war

150
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,799
throughout the galaxy.

151
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:38,638
Perhaps they are the ones
who should be eradicated.

152
00:09:51,995 --> 00:09:54,195
General Kenobi, Anakin,
we're so glad...

153
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,834
Where's Senator Amidala?

154
00:09:55,994 --> 00:09:58,154
- She went to look for the lab.
- And you let her go?

155
00:09:58,233 --> 00:10:02,072
Senator Padme can be very hard to stop
once she has made up her mind.

156
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:06,072
- Good point. I know what you mean.
- This is Peppi Bow.

157
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:07,991
She was the last person to see them.

158
00:10:08,151 --> 00:10:11,911
- Padme sent her here to safety.
- Theysa looking for the sick-maker.

159
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,109
- "They"?
- Representative Binks was with her.

160
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,629
Go with the Gungan.
See if you can find them.

161
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:20,308
You've got it, Master.

162
00:10:25,027 --> 00:10:26,947
Why didn't you send someone
to look for them?

163
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:30,226
Considering the latest developments,
we thought it was best to wait for you.

164
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,306
What latest developments?

165
00:10:33,345 --> 00:10:35,505
We did a robo-lobotomy
on the battle droids

166
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:37,585
and came up
with this piece of memory.

167
00:10:37,665 --> 00:10:38,704
Who is that?

168
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:40,344
Dr. Nuvo Vindi,

169
00:10:40,504 --> 00:10:42,464
the senior medic
for the Perma families.

170
00:10:42,624 --> 00:10:44,063
He disappeared ten years ago.

171
00:10:44,383 --> 00:10:48,143
<i>Good news,
my soulless automaton friends.</i>

172
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,621
<i>We now have enough
of the Blue Shadow virus</i>

173
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:54,141
<i>to start filling the bombs.</i>

174
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,740
He said "bombs. "

175
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,940
<i>We will only need to send one bomb</i>

176
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:01,580
<i>to each key star system.</i>

177
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:05,178
<i>Work quickly.
I want them ready to deliver...</i>

178
00:11:05,818 --> 00:11:09,098
If those bombs get delivered,
we'll be facing a galaxy-wide plague.

179
00:11:09,258 --> 00:11:11,177
The war will be
the least of our worries.

180
00:11:11,497 --> 00:11:12,777
There is some good news.

181
00:11:13,656 --> 00:11:15,496
Senator Amidala found the lab.

182
00:11:15,656 --> 00:11:17,975
She sent us the coordinates
before she disappeared.

183
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,295
We've managed to get
a geo scan of the area.

184
00:11:20,455 --> 00:11:23,494
- It's enormous.
- It looks like there are 3 entry points.

185
00:11:23,574 --> 00:11:25,574
Here, here, and here.

186
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:27,973
This appears to be the main lab.

187
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:29,493
And the bombs?

188
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:32,132
There seems to be
an above average amount of radiation

189
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,411
in this area.

190
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:35,811
It's likely
where they're being assembled.

191
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:38,691
If Padme has alerted them
to our presence in any way...

192
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:42,209
If Padme's in there, and then we go in
guns a-blazin', she may get killed.

193
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:44,049
It is a risk we have to take.

194
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:46,848
Dr. Vindi and those bombs
must not leave the lab.

195
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,208
And if they or we detonate one
during the attack?

196
00:11:50,608 --> 00:11:54,207
Better to have one planet infected
than the entire galaxy.

197
00:11:56,206 --> 00:11:58,286
These the ship belonging to them.

198
00:11:58,526 --> 00:11:59,885
So where are they?

199
00:12:05,804 --> 00:12:07,404
Their tracks end here.

200
00:12:11,323 --> 00:12:12,762
Peppi, it's a scope.

201
00:12:13,322 --> 00:12:15,242
Don't let them see you.

202
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,039
- Where are they?
- Patience.

203
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:30,918
They'll be here in a moment.
You seem a bit on edge.

204
00:12:31,158 --> 00:12:33,798
There's a good chance we're about
to destroy all life on this planet,

205
00:12:33,877 --> 00:12:36,677
including ours and the senator's,
so yes, I'm a bit on edge.

206
00:12:36,837 --> 00:12:38,917
- Why aren't you?
- I'm better at hiding it.

207
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,796
<i>- Master, are you there?
- Did you find her?</i>

208
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:44,915
Negative. I'm pretty sure
she's inside the lab.

209
00:12:44,995 --> 00:12:47,395
<i>The whole area is wired
with pressure sensors.</i>

210
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:49,794
<i>There's no way to get in
without being detected.</i>

211
00:12:49,954 --> 00:12:52,754
<i>- But I'm more than happy to...
- Do not attempt to get inside.</i>

212
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:56,672
<i>I need you to detonate a bunker bomb
at the south end of the facility.</i>

213
00:12:56,753 --> 00:12:59,391
<i>It should cause a nice distraction
and seal off the bomb area</i>

214
00:12:59,552 --> 00:13:01,231
<i>while we come in
through the hatches.</i>

215
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:02,831
You can count on me.

216
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,910
<i>Rex and his men
will be right behind you, Snips.</i>

217
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:06,270
<i>They'll have your back.</i>

218
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,589
Come on, we'd better hurry.

219
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:13,388
Padme may be lost, Anakin.

220
00:13:13,469 --> 00:13:16,108
Don't risk the mission
trying to rescue her.

221
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:18,428
I'll take care of the bombs.
You focus on the doctor.

222
00:13:18,988 --> 00:13:20,747
I know what's at stake here.

223
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:57,779
Now!

224
00:14:02,817 --> 00:14:04,257
We have a breach!

225
00:14:04,497 --> 00:14:06,896
All droids to hatch number one!

226
00:14:08,176 --> 00:14:10,415
Friends of yours, I assume.

227
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,454
They arrived quicker
than I would've thought.

228
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:22,333
- Meesa come too?
- No.

229
00:14:22,652 --> 00:14:24,972
Stay here and make sure
no one escapes.

230
00:14:26,252 --> 00:14:27,212
Okeyday.

231
00:14:57,324 --> 00:14:58,564
It's quiet in here.

232
00:14:58,684 --> 00:15:00,724
Looks like Ahsoka's distraction
is working.

233
00:15:02,683 --> 00:15:04,003
Forward! Come on!

234
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:12,561
Fall back!

235
00:15:31,237 --> 00:15:31,957
Padme!

236
00:15:32,036 --> 00:15:34,996
Take another step
and your friends die.

237
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:37,915
Drop your weapons.

238
00:15:38,915 --> 00:15:39,875
Wait!

239
00:15:41,595 --> 00:15:42,754
Do as he says.

240
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:54,152
I can't hold them.

241
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,070
Need some help?

242
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,230
So good to see you, Master Kenobi.

243
00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:07,749
I realize I won't be able
to hold you for long, Jedi.

244
00:16:08,548 --> 00:16:11,148
That is why
I'm going to give you a choice.

245
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:15,427
Fine with me, as long as
one of the options is killing you.

246
00:16:16,946 --> 00:16:18,866
How about capture me

247
00:16:18,986 --> 00:16:21,226
or save your friends?

248
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:39,421
Are you okay?

249
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:42,580
Ani, how about
the next time you rescue me

250
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,940
before you kill
all the battle droids?

251
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,540
A little "thank you"
would go a long way.

252
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:49,539
Things are going well.

253
00:16:49,658 --> 00:16:53,258
The lab is secure, and hopefully,
Anakin has reached Padme by now.

254
00:16:54,658 --> 00:16:55,977
I'll get the bombs.

255
00:16:56,137 --> 00:16:57,937
I'll keep the droids occupied.

256
00:17:00,256 --> 00:17:02,375
Grab your blasters.
We need to find that doctor.

257
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:06,455
Well, looks like the bomb room.

258
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:08,974
Yes, and luckily,
they appear inactive.

259
00:17:15,253 --> 00:17:17,892
I spoke too soon.
Get these deactivated now!

260
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:20,891
Anakin, I'm guessing
you didn't capture the doctor.

261
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:23,971
I'm working on it.
Do you have the bombs?

262
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,330
<i>I'm working on it.</i>

263
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:27,530
Dr. Vindi has
remotely activated the bombs.

264
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,490
- They're counting down.
- That's great.

265
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,330
<i>And on top of that,</i>

266
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,569
<i>- one of them seems to be missing.
- It's down here somewhere.</i>

267
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:35,568
Ahsoka, we've got another situation.

268
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:37,688
<i>Send all the clones
to search the facility.</i>

269
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,567
- We've got a mis...
- Master?

270
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:42,446
We've got a missing bomb and
a trigger-happy mad doctor on the loose.

271
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:46,166
Missing bomb? I saw Dr. Vindi
give a little droid a bomb.

272
00:17:46,285 --> 00:17:48,485
You guys split up.
Find that droid.

273
00:17:50,045 --> 00:17:52,044
You heard him. Let's move!

274
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:02,842
Jedi!

275
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,681
Leaving so soon, doctor?

276
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,080
You are running out of time.

277
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:14,679
Catch!

278
00:18:27,396 --> 00:18:30,755
Obi-Wan, Dr. Vindi's escaping!
He's at the landing platform.

279
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:33,275
All right.
I'm on my way.

280
00:18:41,793 --> 00:18:43,713
Something smells good in here.

281
00:18:51,311 --> 00:18:52,871
Hey, there, little guy.

282
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,829
How about
you hand that over to me?

283
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:00,829
He's getting away!

284
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:10,786
Ahsoka,
I found the last bomb.

285
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:14,546
Stay there.
I'll get the bomb squad.

286
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,784
Almost got it.

287
00:19:24,943 --> 00:19:28,262
Don't shoot! If he drops
one of those vials, we're finished.

288
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:42,899
No, no-sa!

289
00:19:49,017 --> 00:19:50,897
You're under arrest, Dr. Vindi.

290
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,929
The bomb's going off,
and we're all going to die!

291
00:20:27,968 --> 00:20:29,128
Yeah, die!

292
00:20:32,327 --> 00:20:33,127
Oops.

293
00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:34,207
What happened?

294
00:20:35,007 --> 00:20:37,486
Deactivated.
Plenty of time to spare.

295
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:40,005
Plenty of...

296
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:43,884
- Ahsoka, are you there?
- I'm here, Master.

297
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:46,524
The bomb has been deactivated.
Did you find Vindi?

298
00:20:46,924 --> 00:20:49,004
Deactivated as well.
Have you seen Padme?

299
00:20:49,603 --> 00:20:51,203
She's right next to me.

300
00:20:51,323 --> 00:20:53,482
I'm okay, too.
Thanks for asking.
