1
00:00:17,346 --> 00:00:18,682
<i>Grievous in retreat!</i>

2
00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:24,038
<i>Before the battleship Malevolence could
destroy an Outer Rim clone medical base,</i>

3
00:00:24,153 --> 00:00:28,492
<i>a Republic strike force under the
command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker</i>

4
00:00:28,608 --> 00:00:32,382
<i>crippled the warship,
disabling its dreaded ion cannon.</i>

5
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:38,939
<i>Now the Jedi relentlessly persue
the Malevolence.</i>

6
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,266
Commander, what is the damage level
to the enemy ship?

7
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,669
She's lost a primary shield
and stabilizers.

8
00:01:05,784 --> 00:01:08,789
But the ship is so massive, it can take
all the fire our cannons can give it.

9
00:01:09,124 --> 00:01:11,254
We must summon reinforcements.

10
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:12,944
That's why I'm here, Master Plo.

11
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:15,326
Anakin, were you able to contact
Master Luminara?

12
00:01:15,556 --> 00:01:18,875
Yes, Master. She's busy with a fleet
of Separatist reinforcements nearby.

13
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:21,501
She won't be able to give us support
until she's turned them away.

14
00:01:21,616 --> 00:01:23,620
Then we'll have to make due
with what we have.

15
00:01:33,948 --> 00:01:36,040
We've lost our primary weapon.

16
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:38,601
The hyperdrive has been disabled.

17
00:01:39,428 --> 00:01:40,158
General?

18
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:42,641
General, the forward engines
are shutting down.

19
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,842
Impossible!

20
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:52,289
- Admiral, status report.
- They're not attempting to jump

21
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,726
to hyperspace.
Their hyperdrive must be damaged.

22
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:56,341
This is our chance.

23
00:01:56,457 --> 00:01:59,448
All ships, target the bridge,
maximum firepower.

24
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,572
It has not sustained extensive damage.

25
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,068
<i>General, I have arranged a trap</i>

26
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:17,495
<i>which will give you an advantage
over the Jedi.</i>

27
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:19,975
I assure you, that is unnecessary.

28
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,461
<i>Do not compound your failure this day</i>

29
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:25,459
<i>by allowing our prize warship to fall.</i>

30
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:29,582
My lord, they will never capture me
or this ship.

31
00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:33,562
<i>Heading towards you
is a very important galactic senator.</i>

32
00:02:34,164 --> 00:02:38,503
<i>With her as your hostage,
they will call off their attack.</i>

33
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:41,255
As you wish, my lord.

34
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,111
My lady, are you sure

35
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:49,420
the information
from Chancellor Palpatine is reliable?

36
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:51,480
Yes, it was secretly given to him

37
00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:53,974
by the supreme executive
of the Banking Clan himself.

38
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:56,325
If they leave the Separatist alliance,

39
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,553
it will go a long way
to shortening this war.

40
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,667
We're approaching the system now.

41
00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:06,996
My goodness!

42
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,190
This isn't right!

43
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:12,338
That's a droid warship.
We're in the middle of a battle!

44
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:16,024
Sir, we're scanning a small ship
off our bow.

45
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,361
Good.
Our hostage has arrived.

46
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:26,900
Master, I'm picking up a signal
near the enemy vessel.

47
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,925
Something just came
out of hyperspace.

48
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,765
- Enemy reinforcements?
- No.

49
00:03:31,175 --> 00:03:33,608
It looks like a Naboo ship.

50
00:03:34,188 --> 00:03:35,750
Gunners, stand down.

51
00:03:35,974 --> 00:03:38,042
What in blazes
are they doing out here?

52
00:03:38,157 --> 00:03:39,569
Ahsoka, contact that ship.

53
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:46,148
<i>- Naboo cruiser, identify yourself.
- This is Senator Amidala.</i>

54
00:03:46,262 --> 00:03:48,173
Padme?
What are you doing out here?

55
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:51,682
<i>I was sent on a special mission.
The senate was told the Banking Clan</i>

56
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:54,374
<i>- wanted to negotiate a treaty.
- Get out of there as fast as you can.</i>

57
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,285
Activate the tractor beam.

58
00:03:59,518 --> 00:04:02,898
- Have we been hit?
- I'm afraid it's much worse than that.

59
00:04:05,342 --> 00:04:06,501
Padme, what's happening?

60
00:04:06,653 --> 00:04:09,381
<i>I'm being pulled inside
the droid cruiser by a tractor beam.</i>

61
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:18,625
<i>I will not be made
a Separatist bargaining chip.</i>

62
00:04:18,897 --> 00:04:23,347
<i>Continue your attack.
You must destroy this monstrous ship!</i>

63
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:30,388
Admiral,
order our ships to stop firing.

64
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:45,045
It does not look safe out there,
my lady.

65
00:04:45,308 --> 00:04:48,995
I see now this whole thing was a trap,
and I'm afraid I walked right into it.

66
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,381
Sir, the Republic cruisers
have halted their attack.

67
00:04:52,828 --> 00:04:54,971
Jedi are so predictable.

68
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:56,983
Get the repair team up here.

69
00:04:57,098 --> 00:04:59,305
Continue working on the hyperdrive.

70
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,741
I'm going down to the main hangar.

71
00:05:07,903 --> 00:05:11,336
This ship must be returned
to Count Dooku intact.

72
00:05:17,977 --> 00:05:20,314
There is no room for failure.

73
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:22,092
<i>Rail jet departing.</i>

74
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,559
Come on,
I've overloaded the power system.

75
00:05:29,674 --> 00:05:30,935
We're doomed.

76
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:36,539
- Where do you think you're going?
- Somebody has to save her skin.

77
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:38,858
I thought you might say that.

78
00:05:39,309 --> 00:05:43,683
There he goes again,
craving adventure and excitement.

79
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:45,520
You get used to it.

80
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:51,223
Come on, 3PO, hurry.

81
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:54,425
Hurrying, my lady.
I'm not sure this is such a good idea.

82
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,966
<i>Welcome to rail jet substation 9-4.</i>

83
00:06:03,082 --> 00:06:04,444
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

84
00:06:05,144 --> 00:06:06,300
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

85
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:08,189
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

86
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,356
You two, come with me.

87
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,796
Looks like the engines are set
to destroy themselves.

88
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:25,353
Get out of my way!

89
00:06:25,572 --> 00:06:27,158
Hey, that's just rude!

90
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,767
Watch what you're doing
with that thing.

91
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:45,731
Sound the alarm!

92
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:47,794
We have stowaways on board.

93
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:58,310
I trust you've already formulated
a brilliant plan to rescue the senator.

94
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,541
As a matter of fact, I have.

95
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:02,237
But do we have a plan "B"?

96
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:04,318
Every operation
needs a backup, Anakin.

97
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:08,559
I don't have a backup yet, but I do
have a plan for getting on that ship.

98
00:07:08,981 --> 00:07:09,941
Really?

99
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:12,369
The enemy sensors
are obviously damaged,

100
00:07:12,485 --> 00:07:15,423
so we'll sneak in behind them
and dock at the emergency airlock.

101
00:07:15,717 --> 00:07:16,928
That's your plan?

102
00:07:17,043 --> 00:07:18,424
Just fly there, land,

103
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,805
hope they don't spot us,
and walk in the door?

104
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:22,325
Basically.

105
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,047
Brilliant. Let's get going.

106
00:07:40,645 --> 00:07:43,342
Pardon me, but might I suggest
we keep moving?

107
00:07:43,457 --> 00:07:45,574
I think I hear battle droids
approaching.

108
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:48,082
But we also need
to contact the fleet.

109
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:50,936
If I can just get
this comm panel working...

110
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:56,820
My lady, I'm afraid I was right.

111
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:04,205
<i>- General?
- What?</i>

112
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,269
<i>The damage to the hyperdrive
was not as bad as we first thought.</i>

113
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:09,585
<i>We should be able to
get under way again shortly.</i>

114
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:11,745
I must inform Count Dooku.

115
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,054
Stay here.

116
00:08:13,336 --> 00:08:14,868
Continue the search.

117
00:08:15,104 --> 00:08:17,963
Find the stowaway
and bring them to me.

118
00:08:18,273 --> 00:08:19,541
Roger, roger.

119
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:41,678
If they spot us,
we'll be pulverized.

120
00:08:41,946 --> 00:08:43,839
They're too busy repairing the ship.

121
00:08:43,954 --> 00:08:45,880
They don't have time to notice us.

122
00:08:46,244 --> 00:08:48,838
Subtlety has never been
one of your strong points, Anakin.

123
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:52,083
Everything I know
I learned from you, Master.

124
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,565
If only that were true.

125
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:06,127
- What was that?
- What?

126
00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:08,394
That noise.
Didn't you hear it?

127
00:09:08,752 --> 00:09:11,770
It sounded like a ship
docking at one of the emergency airlocks.

128
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,532
Your circuits are loose.
No one's crazy enough to do that.

129
00:09:16,116 --> 00:09:17,812
Anakin, you're crazy.

130
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:20,094
Spinning is not flying.

131
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,694
- But it's a good trick.
- We do not want to be spotted.

132
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:26,376
- I knew it! It's them!
- Oh, no.

133
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,057
You stay here, R2.

134
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:35,860
<i>Another bold strategy
by Skywalker, I presume.</i>

135
00:09:36,101 --> 00:09:39,197
- That's my master.
- Once they make it off that ship,

136
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:41,706
we'll need reinforcements
to finish off the enemy.

137
00:09:42,335 --> 00:09:43,743
<i>I am on my way, Master Plo.</i>

138
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:46,591
We're receiving a transmission
from inside the Malevolence.

139
00:09:46,882 --> 00:09:48,105
I believe it's the senator.

140
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:50,855
Yes?

141
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,733
<i>Master, we've found the senator.
I'm patching her through.</i>

142
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:55,027
<i>- Padme.
- Anakin.</i>

143
00:09:55,316 --> 00:09:56,858
<i>Are you all right?
Where are you?</i>

144
00:09:56,973 --> 00:10:00,108
On the lower levels.
I'm fine, but I don't know for how long.

145
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:03,230
- Droids are everywhere.
- Obi-Wan and I are on board too.

146
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,272
What?
What are you doing here?

147
00:10:05,515 --> 00:10:07,429
We came to get you off this ship.

148
00:10:07,545 --> 00:10:09,156
Ahsoka,
how can we get to the senator?

149
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,578
According to our scans,
there seems to be

150
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,916
a large open area
in the center of the ship

151
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,036
It should be halfway
between the two of you.

152
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:18,477
We're on our way.
Did you hear that, Padme?

153
00:10:18,807 --> 00:10:19,962
I'll be there.

154
00:10:25,386 --> 00:10:28,849
General, we just detected
an unauthorized communication

155
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:31,524
- coming from within the ship.
- What did it say?

156
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,031
Well...

157
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:35,099
We don't know.

158
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:37,794
We didn't catch it in time.

159
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:40,823
Monitor all internal communications.

160
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,527
I want that senator on this bridge.

161
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:53,925
- I don't see her, Anakin.
- She's here, Master. I sense it.

162
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:01,183
This is where we're supposed
to meet them.

163
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:04,340
He's probably late again.

164
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,844
But we do have company
of another sort.

165
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:08,827
Blast them!

166
00:11:11,883 --> 00:11:12,761
There!

167
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,730
Look, Jedi.

168
00:11:22,846 --> 00:11:24,392
- Fire!
- No, wait.

169
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,914
I knew that was a bad idea.

170
00:11:30,516 --> 00:11:31,324
Jump!

171
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:35,548
Who, me?

172
00:11:40,002 --> 00:11:40,809
Padme!

173
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:46,563
Anakin!

174
00:11:53,241 --> 00:11:54,564
There they are.

175
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,565
Fire!

176
00:12:00,114 --> 00:12:01,224
The bridge is out.

177
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,143
Jump to me.
I'll use the Force.

178
00:12:03,212 --> 00:12:04,926
You have to trust me.

179
00:12:08,722 --> 00:12:11,211
- I've got you.
- Nice catch.

180
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:13,373
I'll fetch the droid.

181
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:19,734
The things you do to get me alone.

182
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:21,316
Stop talking.

183
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,498
What is going on?

184
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:39,383
Stop me, please!

185
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,799
Blast!
That's not good.

186
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,122
Anakin, I got separated
from your droid.

187
00:12:45,237 --> 00:12:45,927
3PO.

188
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:47,962
I'll take care of it.

189
00:12:48,077 --> 00:12:50,748
- We'll meet you back at the Twilight.
- No, we can't leave yet.

190
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:53,708
I overheard Grievous.
Their hyperdrive is almost repaired.

191
00:12:53,862 --> 00:12:55,737
I'm already headed
in that direction,

192
00:12:55,852 --> 00:12:58,871
so I'll make certain
that the hyperdrive stays offline.

193
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:04,792
We'll see about that, Jedi.
Come with me.

194
00:13:05,137 --> 00:13:08,874
I'm getting you out of here.
R2, I need you to help me find 3PO.

195
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:10,424
He's on the rail jet.

196
00:13:10,806 --> 00:13:12,878
I know. I know. He does.

197
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:15,917
Look, just find him for me,
and I'll be there soon.

198
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,670
Someone stop this contraption,
please!

199
00:13:30,497 --> 00:13:32,518
I suppose I did ask for that.

200
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,101
Hello, there.

201
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,618
General Kenobi,

202
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:07,020
did you really think I would leave
the hyperdrive unguarded?

203
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:08,660
Anything is possible.

204
00:14:08,775 --> 00:14:10,659
You haven't exactly
impressed me today.

205
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:13,422
Kill him.

206
00:14:43,062 --> 00:14:44,392
That was impressive.

207
00:14:45,557 --> 00:14:47,027
Guard the hyperdrive.

208
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,653
I will deal with this Jedi myself.

209
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,592
Obi-Wan? Come in, Obi-Wan.

210
00:15:00,707 --> 00:15:03,432
<i>Anakin,
I'm afraid Grievous is on to us.</i>

211
00:15:03,547 --> 00:15:04,965
Yeah, we noticed.

212
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:08,885
<i>We'll rendezvous
back at the Twilight.</i>

213
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,911
<i>The fleet must engage the...</i>

214
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:13,007
Obi-Wan? Come in. Obi-Wan!

215
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:14,969
- What's wrong?
- They're jamming us.

216
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:27,932
- That might buy us some time.
- I suppose you have a plan.

217
00:15:28,342 --> 00:15:29,392
Follow me.

218
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:34,236
I do believe I'm lost...
in enemy territory...

219
00:15:34,697 --> 00:15:35,816
and all alone.

220
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:38,842
Don't shoot!
I surrender!

221
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:41,892
R2-D2!
Oh my,

222
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:44,459
you are a sight for short circuits.

223
00:15:46,188 --> 00:15:48,280
Master Anakin sent you to find me?

224
00:15:48,495 --> 00:15:49,816
What kept you then?

225
00:15:53,795 --> 00:15:56,212
The general is demanding
a status report.

226
00:15:56,327 --> 00:15:58,644
Is the hyperdrive repaired yet?

227
00:15:58,759 --> 00:15:59,984
It's almost done.

228
00:16:00,675 --> 00:16:02,414
I'll give him the good news.

229
00:16:15,873 --> 00:16:18,873
Ever since I've known you,
you've been playing with droids.

230
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,819
I used to put them together.
Now I only take them apart.

231
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:24,316
So where do we start?

232
00:16:24,947 --> 00:16:28,368
First we need to get rid of these droids
so they won't know we were here.

233
00:16:28,483 --> 00:16:31,599
I'm gonna hotwire the ship,
give Grievous a little surprise.

234
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,838
I guess I'll clean up
the droids then.

235
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:41,299
Our ships are in attack position.
Any word from Master Skywalker?

236
00:16:41,623 --> 00:16:44,676
No, the droids are jamming
our transmissions.

237
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:46,821
We need to give him more time.

238
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,814
I'm not sure we can.

239
00:17:31,323 --> 00:17:34,216
That ought to do it.
How's the house-cleaning going?

240
00:17:34,284 --> 00:17:35,785
Done.
Let's get out of here.

241
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:42,535
I guess repairs are finished.

242
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:45,459
- Prepare to charge up the hyperdrive.
- Roger, roger.

243
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,888
R2, are you quite certain
the ship is in this direction?

244
00:17:54,665 --> 00:17:56,368
This way looks potentially dangerous.

245
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,490
I know the whole place is dangerous!

246
00:17:59,992 --> 00:18:03,364
I suggest we stay here
and let Master Anakin find us.

247
00:18:03,962 --> 00:18:06,412
3PO, what are you doing?
Don't just stand there.

248
00:18:06,831 --> 00:18:08,294
Let's get back to the ship.

249
00:18:09,098 --> 00:18:11,834
- Power up the engines, R2.
- Hold the ship!

250
00:18:18,322 --> 00:18:20,023
I'll contact the fleet.

251
00:18:21,262 --> 00:18:22,820
R2, release the docking clamp.

252
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,870
- Time for some clever tricks, Anakin.
- That's what I was thinking.

253
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,114
All batteries, open fire!

254
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:07,664
You know, we have guns.
You can shoot back any time.

255
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,579
- I was just about to...
- I got it.

256
00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:17,281
She seems to know her way around.

257
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:25,781
<i>General, the hyperdrive
has been completely repaired.</i>

258
00:19:25,895 --> 00:19:29,674
<i>- Should we retreat to friendly space?
- Engage the hyperdrive.</i>

259
00:19:29,788 --> 00:19:33,128
I'll meet you at our secret base
in sector four.

260
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:36,816
You heard the general.
Prepare to make the jump to hyperspace.

261
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:37,890
Yes, sir.

262
00:19:49,568 --> 00:19:52,097
- Nice shot, Senator.
- Beginner's luck.

263
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,875
Pardon me, sir,
but R2's scan of the enemy's ship

264
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:57,866
indicates their hyperdrive
is activating.

265
00:19:57,981 --> 00:19:59,537
- Don't worry about it.
- What?

266
00:19:59,878 --> 00:20:02,796
Coordinates are locked.
Hyperdrive is engaging.

267
00:20:04,373 --> 00:20:06,343
I think we have a problem.

268
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:09,105
<i>General, there's something wrong
with the hyperdrive.</i>

269
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,903
I thought the hyperdrive was fixed.

270
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:15,706
The navi-computer is heading us
right into the moon.

271
00:20:16,036 --> 00:20:18,387
Fools!
Reset the navi-computer!

272
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:20,838
Quick, reset the navi-computer!

273
00:20:23,246 --> 00:20:27,031
<i>General, we await the Malevolence
at the rendezvous point.</i>

274
00:20:27,464 --> 00:20:29,512
<i>Have you made your escape yet?</i>

275
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:32,893
No, reset it!

276
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:34,368
<i>General?</i>

277
00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:36,383
General?

278
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:43,998
Transmission has been cut off, sir.

279
00:20:44,151 --> 00:20:46,400
I think the general did it himself.

280
00:20:46,553 --> 00:20:48,424
- We're gonna die!
- Abandon ship!

281
00:20:54,116 --> 00:20:56,162
I imagine you had something
to do with that?

282
00:20:56,842 --> 00:20:59,003
All part of the plan, Master.
