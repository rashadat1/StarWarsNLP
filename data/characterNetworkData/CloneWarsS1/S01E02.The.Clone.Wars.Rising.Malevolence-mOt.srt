1
00:00:17,855 --> 00:00:20,270
<i>The clone starfleet is under siege!</i>

2
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:22,329
<i>Dozens of Republic warships
have been destroyed</i>

3
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:25,662
<i>in merciless surprise attacks
that leave no survivors.</i>

4
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:28,145
<i>Rumors spread of a terrible
new Separatist weapon.</i>

5
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:29,978
<i>In the face of growing fear,</i>

6
00:00:30,141 --> 00:00:32,133
<i>the Jedi Council sends
Master Plo Koon</i>

7
00:00:32,296 --> 00:00:33,877
<i>to hunt down the menace</i>

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,030
<i>before it strikes again.</i>

9
00:00:46,676 --> 00:00:48,733
The enemy ship has reduced
its speed, General.

10
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,217
They must have realized
we're tracking them.

11
00:00:56,165 --> 00:00:58,208
We're tracking three Republic cruisers.

12
00:00:58,275 --> 00:00:59,868
What should we do?

13
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:02,028
Jam their transmissions.

14
00:01:03,877 --> 00:01:05,721
The fleet is holding its position, sire.

15
00:01:05,884 --> 00:01:09,542
I think it wise to report our position
before we attack.

16
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:13,215
Skywalker's fleet is nearby,
in the Bith system.

17
00:01:13,378 --> 00:01:15,908
Good.
Perhaps he can reinforce us.

18
00:01:16,071 --> 00:01:19,263
From what I hear,
Skywalker's always ready for a fight.

19
00:01:19,426 --> 00:01:20,388
So I've heard.

20
00:01:23,163 --> 00:01:24,660
<i>Koh-to-ya, Master Plo.</i>

21
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,579
Koh-to-ya, little 'Soka.

22
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,658
<i>How's the hunt for
the mystery weapon going?</i>

23
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:30,831
We've tracked it to the Abregado system.

24
00:01:30,994 --> 00:01:32,536
We need reinforcements.

25
00:01:32,867 --> 00:01:34,722
<i>I'll have to ask the Council,
Master Plo.</i>

26
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:37,894
<i>I was given strict orders
to protect our staging area.</i>

27
00:01:39,228 --> 00:01:40,813
<i>Master Plo, what's happening...</i>

28
00:01:41,063 --> 00:01:42,832
What is wrong with the transmission?

29
00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:45,372
There's too much interference, sir.
We've lost 'em.

30
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,246
You heard Master Plo.

31
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:49,943
He needs our support.
We have to go help him.

32
00:01:50,106 --> 00:01:52,340
We have to see
what the Council decides first.

33
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:54,201
This is an important meeting, Ahsoka.

34
00:01:54,363 --> 00:01:57,942
Remember, be mindful,
and speak only when spoken to.

35
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,477
Don't I always?

36
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,451
<i>This mystery weapon has struck
in a dozen systems...</i>

37
00:02:03,614 --> 00:02:05,413
<i>and disappeared without a trace.</i>

38
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:09,177
<i>We cannot afford to lose
any more ships, my friends.</i>

39
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,974
<i>Master Skywalker,</i>

40
00:02:11,137 --> 00:02:14,647
<i>have you had any success in finding
General Grievous' secret weapon?</i>

41
00:02:16,264 --> 00:02:19,068
Master Plo was here in the Abregado system
when we lost contact.

42
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:25,027
- The enemy ship is closing.
- Prepare for battle.

43
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:29,558
General Grievous,

44
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:32,577
this will be a suitable test
for our new weapon.

45
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:34,806
You may fire when ready.

46
00:02:35,137 --> 00:02:36,246
Yes, my lord.

47
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,684
We're picking up a large energy reading
from the target, sir.

48
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:44,323
- Open fire.
- We're not in range yet, sir.

49
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,639
Fire!

50
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:53,640
Brace for impact!

51
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:57,574
We're losing all our power.

52
00:02:58,408 --> 00:03:01,236
That energy field has left us
defenseless.

53
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:05,277
- Their shields are down.
- All cannons, fire.

54
00:03:09,444 --> 00:03:10,913
They are tearing us apart one by one.

55
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:24,188
Quickly, into the pods!

56
00:03:28,597 --> 00:03:31,713
We don't have much time.
Get inside! Hurry!

57
00:03:40,134 --> 00:03:43,660
Another successful test,
wouldn't you say, Count?

58
00:03:43,992 --> 00:03:46,110
We must keep our position secret.

59
00:03:46,273 --> 00:03:47,842
Send out the hunters.

60
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:51,337
I want all of those lifepods destroyed.

61
00:03:58,215 --> 00:04:00,407
We've had no further contact
with General Plo Koon.

62
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:02,836
The absence of distress beacons
indicates that his fleet was...

63
00:04:04,326 --> 00:04:06,515
That his fleet was destroyed,
like the others.

64
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:08,420
We are about to prepare a rescue mission.

65
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,281
<i>Hasn't clone intelligence reported</i>

66
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,616
<i>this weapon never leaves any survivors?</i>

67
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:14,948
<i>The Separatists are being unusually tidy.</i>

68
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:16,950
<i>They don't want any witnesses.</i>

69
00:04:17,481 --> 00:04:20,160
<i>Tragic are these losses,
but prevent more...</i>

70
00:04:20,323 --> 00:04:21,415
<i>we must.</i>

71
00:04:24,877 --> 00:04:26,274
The power grid is burned out.

72
00:04:26,437 --> 00:04:28,690
We've no engines,
communications or...

73
00:04:29,117 --> 00:04:30,555
life support recharge.

74
00:04:30,955 --> 00:04:33,310
So, we'll just sit here,
and hold our breath.

75
00:04:33,552 --> 00:04:35,384
Someone will come looking for us,
right?

76
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:40,586
Let's get the power restored,
so we are here to be found.

77
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:50,241
<i>All our battle groups will be reassigned
to guard our supply convoys.</i>

78
00:04:50,404 --> 00:04:52,137
<i>Including yours, Skywalker.</i>

79
00:04:52,388 --> 00:04:55,337
<i>I'm afraid we can't risk
any more ships with a rescue mission.</i>

80
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:56,520
Wait!

81
00:04:56,985 --> 00:04:59,314
Just because there haven't been
any survivors before...

82
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:01,854
doesn't mean there won't be any this time.

83
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:05,332
<i>Boldly spoken for one so young.</i>

84
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,360
<i>She is learning from Anakin.</i>

85
00:05:07,726 --> 00:05:09,150
Excuse my padawan.

86
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,593
We will deploy as you've instructed,
Master.

87
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:15,714
Ahsoka!

88
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:18,633
If anyone could survive,
Master Plo could.

89
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:21,009
- I don't understand why
- What you don't understand...

90
00:05:21,172 --> 00:05:24,213
is Jedi protocol, or your place,
my young padawan.

91
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:25,188
Admiral.

92
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,904
We'll split up our ships
to maximize our defense area.

93
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:29,452
I'll scout ahead for enemy activity.

94
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:32,225
Isn't that risky, with the
mystery weapon out there?

95
00:05:32,556 --> 00:05:35,503
It might be, but I know you won't
argue my orders.

96
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:37,840
Come on, Snips.

97
00:05:43,278 --> 00:05:45,302
The air in here
is getting a bit stale.

98
00:05:45,871 --> 00:05:46,948
Don't look at me.

99
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:50,246
It's Boost, sir. He only takes a bath
when he's on leave.

100
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:53,138
Save it. Just keep working on the pod,
not your jokes.

101
00:05:53,442 --> 00:05:55,377
Do you think
we've got a chance, General?

102
00:05:55,627 --> 00:05:57,575
I don't believe in chance, Commander.

103
00:05:57,907 --> 00:06:00,370
I know if we work together,
we will stay alive...

104
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,730
and someone will find us.

105
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:06,010
With all due respect, General,

106
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:09,997
strategically it doesn't make any sense
for someone to come look for us.

107
00:06:10,373 --> 00:06:12,890
If I was in command,
I'd be huntin' that weapon down.

108
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,089
I value your life...

109
00:06:15,252 --> 00:06:17,567
- more than finding that weapon.
- Sir.

110
00:06:17,987 --> 00:06:19,727
There's another pod out there.

111
00:06:22,097 --> 00:06:24,379
If we only had power,
we could contact them.

112
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:27,650
How 'bout we just wave hello
when the viewport comes around?

113
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:37,116
- They're dead.
- Someone busted that pod wide open.

114
00:06:39,995 --> 00:06:42,212
We are not alone out here.

115
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,838
Set those new coordinates, R2?

116
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:53,634
Master, I should tell you
why I spoke up before.

117
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:55,794
You don't have to explain anything.

118
00:07:10,654 --> 00:07:12,668
Our ships are in defensive formation, sir.

119
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:15,353
All right, Commander.
I'll check on Anakin's progress.

120
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:19,860
Admiral, how goes escort?

121
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:22,832
<i>Oh, convoys are proceeding
on schedule, General.</i>

122
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:24,559
<i>No sign of enemy activity.</i>

123
00:07:24,656 --> 00:07:26,573
And where's Skywalker?

124
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:28,971
<i>The general felt
a redeployment of his fleet</i>

125
00:07:28,972 --> 00:07:31,081
<i>would increase
our defensive perimeter.</i>

126
00:07:31,561 --> 00:07:33,958
I see. Thank you, Admiral.
That will be all.

127
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:37,506
Problem, sir?

128
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,150
Anakin has just
redeployed himself... again.

129
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,773
R2, set up the scanner.
Modulate for incoming...

130
00:07:52,936 --> 00:07:54,392
..."mystery weapons. "

131
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:56,834
No. R2,

132
00:07:56,997 --> 00:07:59,430
tune the scanners for life forms,
highest sensitivity.

133
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,142
Why would we scan for life forms

134
00:08:01,305 --> 00:08:04,149
to spot an enemy weapon
probably just filled with...

135
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,925
...battle droids?

136
00:08:06,635 --> 00:08:07,866
The Abregado system.

137
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:12,065
So it's okay when you don't follow
what the council says!

138
00:08:12,395 --> 00:08:14,693
Doing what the Jedi Council says,
that's one thing,

139
00:08:14,856 --> 00:08:17,107
how we go about doing it,
that's another.

140
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:19,669
That's what I'm trying to teach you,
my young padawan.

141
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,141
So you always meant to
come out here for survivors?

142
00:08:22,391 --> 00:08:25,612
Lives are in danger, Ahsoka.
We can't just turn our backs on them.

143
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:27,411
That's what I said
back in the briefing room!

144
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:30,178
I know,
but the way you said it was wrong.

145
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:33,058
Hurry up,
switch on the illuminator.

146
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:35,736
We haven't got much time
before the fleet misses us.

147
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:39,950
No, that's not it.

148
00:08:40,113 --> 00:08:42,644
This one goes there,
that one goes there.

149
00:08:42,983 --> 00:08:45,502
Are you sure?
We don't want to make things worse.

150
00:08:45,665 --> 00:08:47,838
How are we gonna
make things worse?

151
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,715
When you ask for trouble,

152
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:54,170
you should not be surprised
when it finds you.

153
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,125
I think trouble already found us, sir.

154
00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:00,006
What if we connect these two wires,
right here?

155
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:04,889
I'm getting something.

156
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:08,464
<i>...pod 197... we're under attack.
Is anyone out there?</i>

157
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:10,044
It's one of our other pods.

158
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,218
<i>I repeat, we are under attack!</i>

159
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:15,360
<i>Is anyone out there?!</i>

160
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:18,610
That signal is weak.
They must be close by.

161
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:25,072
<i>They've locked on to our ship!</i>

162
00:09:25,408 --> 00:09:26,637
Go get 'em, boys!

163
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,195
<i>Our position is mark 12 at 0.26.</i>

164
00:09:32,674 --> 00:09:35,473
- Let's cut this can open.
- I have visual contact.

165
00:09:40,802 --> 00:09:43,217
Pod 1977, do you copy?

166
00:09:43,721 --> 00:09:46,510
<i>The droids are hunting for survivors.
They're cutting through!</i>

167
00:09:52,146 --> 00:09:53,136
There they go.

168
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,057
Things just got a lot worse.

169
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:08,034
The scanners are practically useless.
Got anything on the emergency channel, R2?

170
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,774
Now, Ahsoka, we might find something
you don't want to find.

171
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:17,612
I know, Master,
but I have to believe.

172
00:10:17,944 --> 00:10:19,573
How do you know Master Plo anyway?

173
00:10:19,823 --> 00:10:23,237
He's one of my oldest friends.
It was Master Plo Koon who found me

174
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,389
and brought me to the temple
where I belonged.

175
00:10:25,552 --> 00:10:29,113
Now he's lost, so I thought
maybe I could find him.

176
00:10:32,202 --> 00:10:33,847
Incoming transmission, Master.

177
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:36,340
I think someone noticed
we're gone.

178
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:38,023
<i>Anakin, where are you?</i>

179
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,290
Hello, Master. We made a quick stop
in the Abregado system.

180
00:10:42,483 --> 00:10:44,496
<i>For a rescue mission,
I suppose.</i>

181
00:10:44,634 --> 00:10:47,703
<i>- You have other orders.
- It was my idea, Master Obi-Wan.</i>

182
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:49,077
<i>Oh, I'm sure.</i>

183
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,548
<i>- Well, have you found any survivors?
- No, you were right.</i>

184
00:10:52,955 --> 00:10:55,032
The Separatists don't want any witnesses.

185
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:58,445
<i>All the more reason for you
to rejoin the defensive escorts.</i>

186
00:10:58,608 --> 00:10:59,937
<i>We need you, Anakin.</i>

187
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:03,099
<i>You're going to miss the rendezvous
with the fleet if you don't hurry.</i>

188
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,044
I know, Master.
We're on our way.

189
00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:07,295
I'm sorry, Ahsoka.

190
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:16,671
What is it, R2?

191
00:11:17,323 --> 00:11:19,756
R2 thinks he's got something
on the emergency channel.

192
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,117
Can he trace it?

193
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,463
Let's get going.

194
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:26,448
I think they see us.

195
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:29,734
Corporal, there's another pod
over there.

196
00:11:44,244 --> 00:11:45,491
It is time to go.

197
00:11:46,728 --> 00:11:48,359
"Go"?
Where are you going, sir?

198
00:11:48,981 --> 00:11:50,977
Outside, to destroy the enemy.

199
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,277
I can withstand the pressure
for a brief time.

200
00:11:53,654 --> 00:11:54,957
Put your helmets on.

201
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:56,847
If you say so, sir.

202
00:11:57,328 --> 00:11:59,053
This is a difficult situation,

203
00:11:59,246 --> 00:12:02,697
but there remains a possibility
we will survive.

204
00:12:02,986 --> 00:12:05,095
That's good enough for me.
Come on, let's go!

205
00:12:12,477 --> 00:12:15,267
Wolf, keep the communications
signal alive.

206
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:18,353
It is our only chance
someone will find us.

207
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,105
Let's just hope
someone's looking for us.

208
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:28,939
Are we still picking up that signal?

209
00:12:29,312 --> 00:12:31,708
Yes, but why aren't we finding anybody?

210
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,196
I don't know, Ahsoka.
I don't know.

211
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:43,364
Well, this looks like the last one.

212
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,283
Let's finish the job.

213
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:49,885
Hey,
what's a Jedi doing out here?

214
00:12:57,364 --> 00:12:58,515
Take cover.

215
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:02,086
Is there anyone out there?

216
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,885
This is Ahsoka Tano.
Can anyone hear me?

217
00:13:11,117 --> 00:13:12,555
I can't get a clear shot!

218
00:13:12,595 --> 00:13:14,784
Time to put the squeeze on them.

219
00:13:25,563 --> 00:13:27,688
<i>Is there anyone out there?
Come in.</i>

220
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:29,198
<i>This is Ahsoka Tano.</i>

221
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:31,404
<i>Is there anyone out there?
Come in.</i>

222
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:33,203
It's Ahsoka.
She must be close.

223
00:13:33,204 --> 00:13:35,601
Keep the signal alive, Commander.

224
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:37,881
R2, see if you can boost the reception.

225
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:43,998
Patience. We're trying to
boost the power. Hang on.

226
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:57,857
We're losing the signal.
The pod can't take much more damage.

227
00:13:58,106 --> 00:14:00,616
- Sinker, your turn.
- I'm on it, boss.

228
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:04,177
What the...?

229
00:14:04,881 --> 00:14:06,453
Eat laser, clankers.

230
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,886
Sir, we've lost contact with the pod hunter.

231
00:14:26,136 --> 00:14:28,974
Perhaps some survivors are
putting up a fight.

232
00:14:29,404 --> 00:14:31,782
That is something we cannot allow.

233
00:14:35,772 --> 00:14:38,921
<i>We must find a way to destroy
this mystery weapon.</i>

234
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:43,191
<i>In this war, a step ahead of us,
Dooku always seems.</i>

235
00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:46,436
Tell me, has there been any word

236
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:48,826
from Master Plo Koon or his fleet?

237
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:51,642
<i>No.
We must fear the worst.</i>

238
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:53,875
<i>Actually, I just received word</i>

239
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:56,635
<i>that Anakin has found the remains
of Master Plo's fleet</i>

240
00:14:56,798 --> 00:14:58,914
<i>and is searching the debris
for survivors.</i>

241
00:14:59,728 --> 00:15:02,313
On whose authority has he done this?

242
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:03,755
<i>His own, I'm afraid.</i>

243
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:06,431
<i>With his fleet out of position,
we are left vulnerable.</i>

244
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:08,370
<i>Oh, his fleet is right where it should be.</i>

245
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,677
<i>He's taken only a small ship
and his padawan.</i>

246
00:15:12,906 --> 00:15:15,175
<i>Twice the trouble, they have become.</i>

247
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:18,706
<i>A reckless decision,
Skywalker has made.</i>

248
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,660
Let us hope it is not a costly one.

249
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:24,385
Well, General,

250
00:15:24,634 --> 00:15:27,023
another fine mess we've gotten into.

251
00:15:27,272 --> 00:15:29,421
Your sense of humor is improving.

252
00:15:29,672 --> 00:15:31,421
I don't mean to say
"I told you so,"

253
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:34,661
but I never believed
anyone would come looking for us.

254
00:15:39,132 --> 00:15:41,286
<i>Anakin, the Council is furious.</i>

255
00:15:41,605 --> 00:15:43,617
<i>Why have you left your post?</i>

256
00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:46,816
I decided we couldn't just give up
on Master Plo Koon.

257
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:48,393
<i>A noble gesture, Anakin.</i>

258
00:15:48,556 --> 00:15:52,653
<i>But the Council feels
your daring may put others in danger.</i>

259
00:15:53,531 --> 00:15:55,532
<i>Please, listen to me, Anakin.</i>

260
00:15:55,782 --> 00:15:57,265
<i>Return at once.</i>

261
00:15:57,428 --> 00:15:58,698
Yes, Excellency.

262
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,104
Time to go, Ahsoka.

263
00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:14,006
We have to stay.

264
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:16,576
Ahsoka, I want to believe
Master Plo is alive, but...

265
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,509
I know he's alive!

266
00:16:18,774 --> 00:16:20,123
I can sense it.

267
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:28,057
Sergeant,

268
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:31,239
why are you so certain
no one is coming?

269
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:35,157
We're just clones, sir.
We're meant to be expendable.

270
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:36,605
Not to me.

271
00:16:42,045 --> 00:16:44,154
- There they are!
- Ready tow cable.

272
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:49,513
Cable loaded, Master.

273
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:05,825
Come on, hurry!

274
00:17:06,979 --> 00:17:08,821
Are you okay, Master Plo?

275
00:17:09,192 --> 00:17:11,019
There's someone in the pod.

276
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:19,661
Will they be all right?

277
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:21,660
The pressure suits offer some protection,

278
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,139
but they require a medical frigate
for recovery.

279
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:25,979
I will stabilize them, sir.

280
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:27,965
Your men are safe now.

281
00:17:28,908 --> 00:17:31,857
Tell me, were there any survivors?

282
00:17:32,186 --> 00:17:34,176
We couldn't find anybody else.

283
00:17:34,657 --> 00:17:37,518
The hunters must have destroyed the rest.

284
00:17:38,152 --> 00:17:40,224
I'm sorry, Master Plo.

285
00:17:42,444 --> 00:17:44,851
We tracked the mystery weapon
to this system.

286
00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:48,290
That is when we found out
it was an ion cannon.

287
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,609
An ion cannon?

288
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,910
A weapon that neutralizes
all power to our ships,

289
00:17:53,241 --> 00:17:55,370
leaving the targets defenseless.

290
00:17:57,809 --> 00:17:59,340
There's a massive vessel approaching.

291
00:17:59,503 --> 00:18:01,931
Shut down the power systems
before they detect us.

292
00:18:08,815 --> 00:18:09,773
The droid!

293
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:14,136
Sorry, little guy.

294
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,044
That is one big cruiser-crusher.

295
00:18:35,893 --> 00:18:38,121
There's still no signal from the pod hunter.

296
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:40,904
Reduce speed and activate your scanners.

297
00:18:41,349 --> 00:18:43,526
We will find who is responsible.

298
00:18:49,871 --> 00:18:52,579
- Hey, what's with the lights?
- Power's gone out.

299
00:18:53,004 --> 00:18:55,778
Maybe that ship has returned.
We should get up to the bridge.

300
00:18:56,851 --> 00:18:58,217
You're too weak.

301
00:18:58,468 --> 00:19:00,137
Let me go see what is wrong.

302
00:19:13,342 --> 00:19:15,780
We're picking up
a faint signal from a droid.

303
00:19:15,943 --> 00:19:18,689
It's not one of ours.
They're right behind us.

304
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:21,914
Move us into attack position.

305
00:19:26,305 --> 00:19:27,736
They're coming back.

306
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:29,900
Are all the systems shut down?

307
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:31,884
Is there a problem, sir?

308
00:19:32,135 --> 00:19:34,643
We forgot to shut off the medical droid.

309
00:19:34,894 --> 00:19:36,483
We've got to
get the power back on now!

310
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:38,629
- May I be of assistance?
- No, thanks.

311
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:40,602
Just get in the back
and take care of the clones.

312
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:42,507
That is my programming, sir.

313
00:19:42,575 --> 00:19:44,568
- Come on, we've gotta get out of here.
- I know! I know!

314
00:19:49,094 --> 00:19:52,508
Sir, the enemy is attempting to flee
through the debris field.

315
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:55,708
General,
I don't want any witnesses.

316
00:19:56,037 --> 00:19:57,907
Energize plasma rotors.

317
00:20:01,636 --> 00:20:04,664
R2, program the navicomputer.
Be ready to get us out of here.

318
00:20:04,915 --> 00:20:06,383
You forgot we turned him off.

319
00:20:08,953 --> 00:20:10,342
Koh-to-ya, droid.

320
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,661
Target range almost locked, sir.

321
00:20:13,991 --> 00:20:16,128
They're not going to make it.

322
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,259
R2, program the hyperdrive.

323
00:20:19,989 --> 00:20:21,098
Anywhere.
Hurry!

324
00:20:21,348 --> 00:20:23,097
Enemy ship targeted, General.

325
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,137
Fire!

326
00:20:45,382 --> 00:20:46,288
Master?

327
00:21:01,325 --> 00:21:02,332
We're clear.

328
00:21:09,756 --> 00:21:12,759
Now the Republic will learn
of our ion cannon.

329
00:21:20,885 --> 00:21:23,484
Your failure is most unfortunate.

330
00:21:23,974 --> 00:21:27,184
I will have to discuss this
with my master.

331
00:21:30,553 --> 00:21:32,438
- Get back to work!
- Roger, roger.

332
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:45,106
Thanks for getting us out of there
in one piece, General Skywalker.

333
00:21:45,436 --> 00:21:46,786
You have my padawan to thank for that.

334
00:21:47,203 --> 00:21:49,357
She always said
you guys would pull through.

335
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,973
General Plo said
someone would come for us.

336
00:21:52,136 --> 00:21:53,504
We're glad he was right.

337
00:21:53,754 --> 00:21:56,518
Skywalker,
it is time to give our report

338
00:21:56,657 --> 00:21:57,702
to the Council.

339
00:21:57,952 --> 00:22:00,154
Right, the Council report...

340
00:22:02,385 --> 00:22:03,500
Come on, Ahsoka.

341
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,216
You want me there?

342
00:22:05,379 --> 00:22:08,897
- I figured because of before...
- Ahsoka, through it all you never gave up.

343
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:12,583
You did a great job.
But if I'm getting in trouble for this,

344
00:22:12,947 --> 00:22:14,591
you're gonna share
some of the blame, too.

345
00:22:15,537 --> 00:22:17,076
So come on, let's go.

346
00:22:18,063 --> 00:22:19,679
Right beside you, sky guy.
