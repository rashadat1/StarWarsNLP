1
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:20,729
<i>The Republic fleet is on the defensive
and pushed to the brink...</i>

2
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:24,528
<i>as war rages in the much-contested
Outer Rim territories.</i>

3
00:00:25,328 --> 00:00:29,127
<i>Chaos and fear mount as the
Separatist army rages an epic battle</i>

4
00:00:29,527 --> 00:00:31,646
<i>against heavily outnumbered
Republic ships.</i>

5
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:34,046
<i>In the far reaches of the Quell system,</i>

6
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:36,766
<i>Anakin Skywalker
and his padawan, Ahsoka,</i>

7
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:40,365
<i>race across the galaxy
to aid Jedi Knight Aayla Secura,</i>

8
00:00:40,685 --> 00:00:42,685
<i>who is in the midst
of a fight for her life</i>

9
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:45,164
<i>as the sinister droid army closes in.</i>

10
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:47,123
Our shields are gone.

11
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:51,723
Hurry, Skywalker.
We're depending on you.

12
00:00:54,682 --> 00:00:55,802
Prepare the gunships.

13
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,319
We have them now.

14
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,719
Send in the super droids.

15
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:19,357
Commander, get out there
and stop those droids.

16
00:01:19,477 --> 00:01:20,436
I'm on it.

17
00:01:22,717 --> 00:01:23,516
This way.

18
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:27,155
We're ready, Admiral.

19
00:01:33,514 --> 00:01:35,954
- General, Skywalker's here.
- And none too soon.

20
00:01:36,114 --> 00:01:37,473
We're entering the atmosphere.

21
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:01,389
Rocket droids incoming.

22
00:02:11,227 --> 00:02:12,907
Those droids are boarding
Aayla's ship.

23
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:22,464
Take care of that flanker.
I'll be on board Aayla's cruiser.

24
00:02:22,824 --> 00:02:24,824
Master, are you sure
that's the wisest thing...

25
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:47,740
- Hey, kid...
- I know, I know. I'm hanging on.

26
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:57,338
This is taking too long.

27
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,177
Destroy that cruiser.

28
00:02:59,617 --> 00:03:02,697
But, sir, there are still
hundreds of droids on board.

29
00:03:02,977 --> 00:03:04,136
I don't care.

30
00:03:04,656 --> 00:03:05,736
Roger, roger.

31
00:03:30,331 --> 00:03:32,171
Nice entrance, Skywalker.

32
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,850
How do you plan
to get us out of this mess?

33
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,609
Well, I have a ship docking
in the lower hangar as we speak.

34
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:45,208
- Activate docking port.
- On it.

35
00:03:48,048 --> 00:03:48,807
Hold it.

36
00:03:55,926 --> 00:03:57,166
We made it.

37
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:01,445
Gangway locked in, sir.

38
00:04:08,524 --> 00:04:09,443
It's too late.

39
00:04:11,603 --> 00:04:12,483
Master!

40
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:23,881
- Don't move the ship.
- Are you guys all right down there?

41
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:32,998
Ahsoka, we have to leave now.

42
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:36,398
Hurry. Get him on the ship.

43
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,077
I'm going to turn on
the deflector shields.

44
00:04:41,757 --> 00:04:42,716
Gangway release.

45
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:53,755
<i>You'll never be able to dock with our ship
in the middle of this battle.</i>

46
00:04:54,075 --> 00:04:55,474
We have no choice, Admiral.

47
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:57,673
General Skywalker's condition
may be critical.

48
00:04:57,793 --> 00:04:59,633
We must get him
on board the Resolute.

49
00:04:59,954 --> 00:05:01,393
<i>Are all Jedi so reckless?</i>

50
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,752
Just the good ones.

51
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,791
The hyperdrive's been activated.

52
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:16,150
- Shut it down.
- I can't.

53
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,229
<i>- General Secura, what's going on?
- We're going into hyperspace.</i>

54
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:22,309
<i>- Detach. Detach!
- They'll take us with them.</i>

55
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:23,468
Evasive maneuvers.

56
00:05:29,188 --> 00:05:31,667
Plot every course
along their last known trajectory.

57
00:05:31,787 --> 00:05:34,347
We need to finish this battle
and find them.

58
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:42,985
I need you with Commander Bly
up on the bridge right now.

59
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:46,424
I should stay.
Commander Bly doesn't need my help.

60
00:05:46,544 --> 00:05:47,583
Anakin does.

61
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:51,303
You can help Anakin
by getting this ship to safety.

62
00:05:53,143 --> 00:05:55,542
- General Secura, we have a problem.
- What is it, Commander?

63
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,102
In our haste to escape,
the navi-computer's coordinates

64
00:05:58,262 --> 00:06:02,421
were inputted incorrectly, and...
well, we're headed right for a star.

65
00:06:21,657 --> 00:06:24,817
It's no use. The navigation computer
is completely fried.

66
00:06:24,977 --> 00:06:27,376
Shut down all power circuits
to reset the coordinates.

67
00:06:27,856 --> 00:06:29,735
That will cut off
Anakin's life support.

68
00:06:30,095 --> 00:06:31,535
I don't like it any more
than you do,

69
00:06:31,655 --> 00:06:34,255
but it's a risk
we're going to have to take.

70
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:42,253
We're switching off
primary power units.

71
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:44,733
Cutting it awfully close.

72
00:06:44,973 --> 00:06:46,572
Ready to shut off auxiliary power.

73
00:06:47,612 --> 00:06:48,492
On three.

74
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,811
One, two,

75
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:52,931
three.

76
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,767
We're out of hyperspace.
Resume all power.

77
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:19,446
Switch the power back on.
What are you waiting for?

78
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:24,124
Hurry. Hurry!

79
00:07:37,162 --> 00:07:41,242
We're not going to crash into the star,
but we're definitely gonna hit that planet.

80
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:08,555
Everyone, out!

81
00:08:21,953 --> 00:08:23,433
Well, we made it.

82
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,112
And Master Skywalker is still alive.

83
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:29,192
I'm just glad he wasn't awake
to see that landing.

84
00:08:29,752 --> 00:08:31,391
He would have been proud.

85
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,671
I've certainly perfected
the art of demolishing ships

86
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:37,030
and almost getting my master killed.

87
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:54,906
Anakin doesn't have much time.
We have to find help tonight.

88
00:08:57,906 --> 00:09:01,186
You and Bly go south.
Rex and I will stay here with Anakin.

89
00:09:01,466 --> 00:09:02,465
No, Ahsoka.

90
00:09:02,905 --> 00:09:05,425
In order to get help quickly,
we must work together.

91
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:07,104
I can't leave him.

92
00:09:07,225 --> 00:09:10,744
Master, I know if I was hurt,
he'd never leave me behind.

93
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:12,943
I know this is hard, Ahsoka,

94
00:09:13,263 --> 00:09:16,342
but Anakin has to stay behind,
and we have to go now.

95
00:09:16,982 --> 00:09:19,382
There is nothing more
we can do for him.

96
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:24,061
We must do all we can
to get off this planet.

97
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:27,540
As a Jedi, it is your duty
to do what is best for the group.

98
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:40,857
General Secura, look.

99
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:45,577
We're not the only ones here
on this planet.

100
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:48,536
There has to be some kind
of something here.

101
00:09:55,735 --> 00:09:59,014
If you don't mind me asking, General Secura,
where exactly are we going?

102
00:09:59,334 --> 00:10:01,333
To go find the people
who live on this planet.

103
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,533
Where are we going to find them?
We have no idea where they are.

104
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:08,692
It seems to me
that the people we're looking for

105
00:10:08,811 --> 00:10:10,931
live near giant trees.

106
00:10:11,932 --> 00:10:13,611
Very perceptive, Padawan.

107
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,130
Be strong, Master,

108
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,369
just a little bit longer.

109
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,410
Rex will watch over you.

110
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:23,809
- It is time to go.
- Don't worry, kid.

111
00:10:24,168 --> 00:10:25,929
I'll take good care of him.

112
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,088
Captain Rex, keep your locator on.
We should be back by daybreak

113
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:34,807
with whoever or whatever lives
on this planet.

114
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,487
Got it, General Secura.

115
00:10:36,607 --> 00:10:38,806
Hey, kid. Good luck.

116
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,286
Come on, guys.
Let's move out.

117
00:10:51,203 --> 00:10:55,203
I can still sense your worry for Anakin,
your attachment to him.

118
00:10:55,523 --> 00:10:56,602
It's just...

119
00:10:57,002 --> 00:10:59,082
I get so confused sometimes.

120
00:10:59,402 --> 00:11:02,002
It's forbidden for Jedi
to form attachments,

121
00:11:02,122 --> 00:11:04,481
yet we are supposed
to be compassionate.

122
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:07,201
It is nothing
to be ashamed of, Ahsoka.

123
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,480
I went through the same process
when I was your age with my own master.

124
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,840
Really?

125
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,959
You?

126
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:14,839
He was like a father to me.

127
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,199
I realized that for the greater good
I had to let him go.

128
00:11:18,718 --> 00:11:21,677
Don't lose a thousand lives
just to save one.

129
00:11:22,357 --> 00:11:23,237
Maybe.

130
00:11:23,877 --> 00:11:27,036
But that doesn't mean
that I can't try to save his life.

131
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:24,185
I don't see any signs of life.

132
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:27,064
Watch out!

133
00:12:31,824 --> 00:12:33,383
No wonder it's deserted.

134
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,823
It's a death trap.

135
00:12:35,063 --> 00:12:38,543
You'd have to be crazy
to want to dodge those on a daily basis.

136
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:42,701
It looks like someone or something
intelligent enough to figure out

137
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:45,141
a use for the pods
has dragged them away.

138
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:48,660
All we have to do is follow the trail.
Let's go.

139
00:13:17,654 --> 00:13:18,694
General?

140
00:13:19,614 --> 00:13:20,974
Are you all right?

141
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:22,053
Be...

142
00:13:22,814 --> 00:13:23,733
Behind you.

143
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,093
What the...?

144
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:06,085
Watch your left!

145
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,040
Cameron's dead.

146
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,000
So are Lucky and Flesh.

147
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,679
We have to keep moving.

148
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:10,352
Pod central.
We made it.

149
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,110
Hello?

150
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:28,668
What have you come here for?

151
00:15:29,188 --> 00:15:32,587
We are peacekeepers.
We are Jedi from the galactic Republic.

152
00:15:33,027 --> 00:15:36,547
Our ship crashed a few miles away,
and one of us is very badly injured.

153
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:38,067
We need your help.

154
00:15:38,546 --> 00:15:42,065
Violence breeds violence.
Jedi are no peacekeepers.

155
00:15:45,665 --> 00:15:46,945
We're fighting for freedom.

156
00:15:47,385 --> 00:15:50,304
And freedom and peace
require fear and death?

157
00:15:52,264 --> 00:15:56,263
We colonized this system
to find solace from your wretched war.

158
00:15:56,862 --> 00:15:58,623
We came here to find peace.

159
00:15:59,342 --> 00:16:00,542
You must leave.

160
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:03,982
You will only destroy what small amount
of peace is left in the galaxy.

161
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,541
You will only bring
the destruction of us.

162
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:10,700
Regardless of the clone wars
and our part in them,

163
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,379
we still need your help.

164
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,739
I'm afraid I must do
what's best for my people.

165
00:16:15,859 --> 00:16:17,259
We cannot help you.

166
00:16:18,538 --> 00:16:19,498
Please.

167
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,738
Can you at least give us
some medical supplies?

168
00:16:22,377 --> 00:16:23,897
My friend is dying.

169
00:16:31,336 --> 00:16:33,336
I cannot ignore a plea for help.

170
00:16:33,856 --> 00:16:36,575
I will send my son Wag Too
to help your friend.

171
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:39,895
He is a healer.
But only one Jedi may go with him.

172
00:16:40,254 --> 00:16:42,454
The other must stay as insurance.

173
00:16:42,854 --> 00:16:45,213
We wouldn't want
a surprise attack on our village

174
00:16:45,534 --> 00:16:47,612
or the kidnapping
of our only healer.

175
00:16:48,452 --> 00:16:49,892
Bly and I will stay.

176
00:16:50,252 --> 00:16:52,212
Padawan,
go and help your master.

177
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,931
The clone and his blaster
cannot stay.

178
00:16:56,051 --> 00:16:58,179
- He will go with the youngling.
- I can handle it.

179
00:16:58,299 --> 00:16:59,354
I don't need help.

180
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,330
- Ahsoka.
- Don't worry.

181
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,969
Be mindful of your surroundings,
Padawan.

182
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,849
Those creatures are still out there.

183
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:07,289
Got it.

184
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:09,888
We won't be long.

185
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:29,844
Here. It will restore your energy.

186
00:17:30,444 --> 00:17:31,444
Thank you.

187
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:36,923
I am sure you are aware that the Jedi
did not initiate the clone wars.

188
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:40,962
Our only intention is to end it
and restore peace to our galaxy.

189
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:46,041
What difference does it make
who started the war

190
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:48,041
and who only wants to end it?

191
00:17:48,161 --> 00:17:51,160
No side is free of fault.
It takes two to fight.

192
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,719
But isn't liberty worth fighting for?

193
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:55,959
But is it worth killing for?

194
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:58,879
Fighting for something
doesn't necessarily mean

195
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:01,518
you have to destroy
everything in your path.

196
00:18:02,118 --> 00:18:06,197
Only when you lay your arms down
and pursue a course of nonviolence

197
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:10,196
can you make this claim to me
that the Jedi are peacekeepers.

198
00:18:34,152 --> 00:18:36,431
General, you need to
maintain your rest.

199
00:18:36,911 --> 00:18:38,710
I can't rest.

200
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,630
Rex, they're coming.

201
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,470
I can hear them.

202
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,750
We must fight.

203
00:19:11,264 --> 00:19:12,184
No, don't!

204
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:18,742
Fine.

205
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,860
Good work, little guy.

206
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:37,779
Master!

207
00:19:41,778 --> 00:19:43,378
Good to see you, Snips.

208
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,857
This is Wag Too.
He's a healer.

209
00:19:47,337 --> 00:19:49,937
- He can make you well again.
- Don't you worry.

210
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,976
I can fix you right up.

211
00:20:10,012 --> 00:20:11,052
Snips?

212
00:20:15,052 --> 00:20:17,931
The oil from the pods
will aid in the healing process.

213
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,130
Don't worry.
You'll be well in no time.

214
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:34,808
You were right all along,
Master Secura.

215
00:20:35,127 --> 00:20:36,127
About what?

216
00:20:36,647 --> 00:20:37,927
If I had stayed with Anakin,

217
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:41,527
we probably wouldn't have found
this village in time to save him.

218
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:46,645
At least
this whole ordeal is over now.

219
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:52,324
We still have to find
a way off this planet.

220
00:20:53,924 --> 00:20:57,203
Well, I'm sure Admiral Yularen and
the Republic fleet are looking for us.

221
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,682
It shouldn't take them too long
to get here.
