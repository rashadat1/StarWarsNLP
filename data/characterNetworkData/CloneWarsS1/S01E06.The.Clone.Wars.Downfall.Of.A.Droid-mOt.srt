1
00:00:17,255 --> 00:00:21,295
<i>After suffering a series of disastrous defeats
at the hands of General Grievous,</i>

2
00:00:21,328 --> 00:00:24,654
<i>the Republic's foothold
in the Outer Rim is in jeopardy.</i>

3
00:00:24,694 --> 00:00:27,374
<i>Commissioned to protect
the strategic world of Bothawui,</i>

4
00:00:27,408 --> 00:00:29,621
<i>Anakin Skywalker
and his weary battle group</i>

5
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:33,495
<i>are all that stands between the system
and domination by the droid army.</i>

6
00:00:39,214 --> 00:00:42,340
<i>Among our most recent losses
was the battle group at Falleen.</i>

7
00:00:42,374 --> 00:00:45,814
<i>The Separatist fleet commanded
by General Grievous is headed your way.</i>

8
00:00:45,848 --> 00:00:48,615
Seems like that coward always knows
where and when to attack us.

9
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,295
<i>You're heavily outnumbered, Anakin.</i>

10
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:51,415
<i>I advise retreat.</i>

11
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:52,221
If we run,

12
00:00:52,254 --> 00:00:54,254
the Separatists will
take control of this sector.

13
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:55,571
I can't let them do that.

14
00:00:55,604 --> 00:00:56,949
<i>And that is your problem.</i>

15
00:00:56,983 --> 00:00:58,294
Master Kenobi is right.

16
00:00:58,327 --> 00:00:59,500
We should regroup.

17
00:00:59,534 --> 00:01:01,575
- We don't stand a chance against-
- Ahsoka.

18
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:03,651
Suicide is not the Jedi way, Master.

19
00:01:03,685 --> 00:01:05,695
<i>You should listen to your Padawan.</i>

20
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:07,816
As you listened to yours,
my old Master?

21
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:09,861
No, we are going to stay and fight.

22
00:01:09,895 --> 00:01:12,495
And I think I know how to
beat Grievous at his own game.

23
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:24,780
Our spies were right, General.

24
00:01:24,814 --> 00:01:28,014
The Jedi have positioned a fleet
beyond the planetary rings.

25
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:37,654
Move our ships through
the asteroid field to engage them.

26
00:01:37,688 --> 00:01:39,691
Through the field, sir?

27
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,661
If we attack from above,

28
00:01:41,695 --> 00:01:43,495
they will have the advantage.

29
00:01:43,535 --> 00:01:46,375
So we will go through the rocks.

30
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,301
That didn't sound good.

31
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:58,254
All power to the forward shields.

32
00:01:58,334 --> 00:02:00,615
What if they attack us from behind?

33
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:02,461
They can't.

34
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:05,055
The asteroids will protect us.

35
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,195
Gold Squadron, tighten formation.

36
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:20,015
Slow approach.
Let's draw them in.

37
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:20,855
Yes, sir.

38
00:02:21,535 --> 00:02:22,661
Don't worry, R2.

39
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:25,095
Grievous is falling right into our trap.

40
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:35,215
Resolute command to Gold Leader.

41
00:02:35,249 --> 00:02:36,460
We are standing by.

42
00:02:36,494 --> 00:02:38,134
Enemy closing to zone six.

43
00:02:38,734 --> 00:02:39,934
Patience, Ahsoka.

44
00:02:40,254 --> 00:02:42,655
<i>Zone four.
Zone three.</i>

45
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:48,375
General, we have a clear shot
at their cruisers.

46
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:50,974
Good. Good!

47
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:53,654
They're right on top of us.

48
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:54,694
Should we commence firing?

49
00:02:54,728 --> 00:02:56,821
Wait. Wait.

50
00:02:56,854 --> 00:03:00,216
Concentrate fire on
the closest Republic cruiser.

51
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,376
Roger, roger.

52
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,540
We're outgunned.

53
00:03:12,574 --> 00:03:14,774
We're not gonna last
a mynock minute out here.

54
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:16,021
Hang on, Ahsoka.

55
00:03:16,054 --> 00:03:17,374
We've got 'em
right where we want 'em.

56
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:21,454
Watch your stabilizer, Gold Six!

57
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:28,975
It's no good. Incoming's too heavy.

58
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:33,616
Gold Squadron, take evasive action.

59
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:34,495
Sir, yes, sir.

60
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:35,255
Breaking off.

61
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:40,661
No, R2, we're not retreating.

62
00:03:40,695 --> 00:03:42,375
Good thing you gave us
that extra power.

63
00:03:45,895 --> 00:03:47,615
Let's finish them off!

64
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:52,274
Ahsoka, they're in position.

65
00:03:52,307 --> 00:03:53,894
Unveil our little surprise.

66
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:54,980
Right away, Master.

67
00:03:55,014 --> 00:03:57,335
Rex, old boy,
it's time you joined the party.

68
00:03:57,369 --> 00:03:58,815
With pleasure, sir.

69
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,054
General, we've been outflanked.

70
00:04:11,055 --> 00:04:12,575
All units, fire at will.

71
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,495
Impossible!

72
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,014
Forward cannon, let 'em have it.

73
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:29,936
This is too easy.

74
00:04:36,495 --> 00:04:37,695
Get us out of here!

75
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,335
Uh, where are we supposed to go?

76
00:04:42,975 --> 00:04:44,175
Uh, General?

77
00:04:44,455 --> 00:04:46,656
Well, I guess I'm in charge now.

78
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:06,175
Grievous!

79
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:12,095
Let's finish this.

80
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,334
All batteries,
target that command bucket.

81
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:23,415
He's powering up his hyperdrive, R2.

82
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:23,936
Hang on.

83
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:28,176
More speed, R2.

84
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:31,934
See what you can do
about that, buddy.

85
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:42,296
I got a bad feeling about this.

86
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:01,014
What happened?

87
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:03,494
You owe Rexster your skin, Skyguy.

88
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:04,942
Just doing my job, sir.

89
00:06:04,975 --> 00:06:06,535
It was your plan that won the day.

90
00:06:06,568 --> 00:06:07,861
Grievous is AWOL,

91
00:06:07,895 --> 00:06:10,856
but his fleet of tinnies
is nothing but spare parts.

92
00:06:11,615 --> 00:06:13,176
Good work, both of you.

93
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:14,655
Where is R2?

94
00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:16,615
I'm sorry, Master.

95
00:06:16,648 --> 00:06:17,535
He is gone.

96
00:06:22,456 --> 00:06:23,942
<i>Congratulations, Anakin.</i>

97
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:26,176
<i>Your resourcefulness always amazes me.</i>

98
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,456
Thank you, Master.

99
00:06:27,856 --> 00:06:28,821
<i>You look troubled.</i>

100
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,941
I lost R2 in the field.

101
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,501
<i>Well, R2 units are a dime a dozen.</i>

102
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:35,534
<i>I'm sure you'll find
a suitable replacement.</i>

103
00:06:35,568 --> 00:06:37,535
I could take a squad out there,
track him down.

104
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:39,821
<i>Anakin, it's only a droid.</i>

105
00:06:39,855 --> 00:06:42,416
<i>You know
attachment is not acceptable for a Jedi.</i>

106
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:43,575
It's not just that, Master.

107
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:45,734
Uh, how do I put this?

108
00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:48,494
I didn't wipe R2's memory.

109
00:06:48,528 --> 00:06:49,421
<i>What?</i>

110
00:06:49,454 --> 00:06:52,735
<i>He's still programmed
with our tactics and base locations?</i>

111
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:54,742
<i>If the Separatists get ahold of him...</i>

112
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:58,096
<i>What possessed you
not to erase that droid's memory?</i>

113
00:06:58,129 --> 00:06:59,021
Master Obi-Wan,

114
00:06:59,055 --> 00:07:02,775
sometimes R2 having that
extra information has come in handy.

115
00:07:02,809 --> 00:07:05,382
<i>Well, then find that droid, Anakin.</i>

116
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,775
<i>Our necks might very well depend on it.</i>

117
00:07:07,814 --> 00:07:08,654
Right away, Master.

118
00:07:19,975 --> 00:07:21,382
You ready to go, Snips?

119
00:07:21,415 --> 00:07:24,975
Master, they just delivered
your replacement astromech droid.

120
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:27,096
This is R3-S6.

121
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:34,015
I've heard that the new R3s
are far faster in thinking skills

122
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:36,495
and more powerful than the old R2 units.

123
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:39,696
And best of all, Master,

124
00:07:39,736 --> 00:07:40,776
he is gold.

125
00:07:40,816 --> 00:07:45,134
A gold droid for Gold Leader
of Gold Squadron.

126
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:47,015
You can't replace R2.

127
00:07:47,814 --> 00:07:50,255
Don't worry, Goldie.
You'll get to know him later.

128
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:51,175
Come on.

129
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,615
There's my ship.

130
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,582
R2 is gone.

131
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:11,022
He must have escaped.

132
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:12,455
He's got to be around here somewhere.

133
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:14,981
R2 isn't on the scanners.

134
00:08:15,014 --> 00:08:16,455
But there is a ship out there.

135
00:08:23,256 --> 00:08:25,022
Looks like a Trandoshan scavenger,

136
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:27,134
probably combing
the battlefield for salvage.

137
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:28,941
The historical texts say...

138
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,175
Archive texts can only teach you
a part of the picture,

139
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:32,021
my young Padawan.

140
00:08:32,055 --> 00:08:34,535
You'll learn a lot more
through some hands-on experience.

141
00:08:42,774 --> 00:08:45,815
Ugh! What's that smell?

142
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:48,615
You'll get used to it.

143
00:08:56,016 --> 00:08:58,176
Hey, we'd like to buy a droid.

144
00:08:58,209 --> 00:08:59,016
You sellin'?

145
00:09:12,974 --> 00:09:14,821
We're looking for an R2 unit.

146
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,415
You happen to pick up any recently?

147
00:09:16,448 --> 00:09:18,343
An "R" series?

148
00:09:18,376 --> 00:09:21,422
No, no, not for a long time.

149
00:09:21,456 --> 00:09:25,615
Pookums here really has
her heart set on another R2.

150
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:26,975
She lost the last one.

151
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:28,096
"Pookums"?

152
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:29,955
Oh, brother.

153
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:31,776
Nice R3 unit.

154
00:09:31,816 --> 00:09:34,175
Trade for a C-14?

155
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:36,222
Not on your life, lizardo.

156
00:09:36,256 --> 00:09:38,096
Now let's see how much I have here.

157
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:40,221
I tell you what.

158
00:09:40,255 --> 00:09:44,135
I may have an R2 unit
buried somewhere in the hold.

159
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,661
Help yourself.
But be careful.

160
00:09:48,695 --> 00:09:52,135
There are many, um,
unique items down here.

161
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:10,935
Master?

162
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:17,555
These must be the unique items
we were warned about.

163
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:20,296
These assassin droids
can be very unpredictable.

164
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,301
They're switched off.

165
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:22,735
They don't look so tough to me.

166
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:24,261
Nothing looks tough to you.

167
00:10:24,295 --> 00:10:26,535
Take my word for it,
they're deadly.

168
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,775
R3, access the computer
and find the inventory manifest.

169
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:37,735
R2's gotta be around here somewhere.

170
00:10:43,615 --> 00:10:45,662
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

171
00:10:45,696 --> 00:10:48,336
- That sounded like R2.
- How can you tell the difference?

172
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,536
It came from down here.

173
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,056
R3, get this open.

174
00:10:54,975 --> 00:10:56,335
We don't need the lights on!

175
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:58,136
No, Goldie. The hatch.

176
00:10:58,176 --> 00:10:59,894
Never mind.
I'll do it myself.

177
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,056
Master!

178
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:20,816
Goldie, shut these droids down!

179
00:11:24,536 --> 00:11:27,055
I'm afraid R3 is a little slow
on the uptake.

180
00:11:44,816 --> 00:11:46,576
Back at you, piston head.

181
00:11:59,656 --> 00:12:02,136
You were right about
the hands-on experience, gramps.

182
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,652
Much better than the archives.

183
00:12:03,686 --> 00:12:05,135
Good job, but you missed one.

184
00:12:09,975 --> 00:12:11,741
As for you, Stubby,

185
00:12:11,775 --> 00:12:13,736
you'd make a poor excuse
for a light switch.

186
00:12:15,096 --> 00:12:16,475
I'm sure he did his best.

187
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:17,856
His best to get us killed?

188
00:12:17,975 --> 00:12:19,975
R2 would have never
made that mistake.

189
00:12:20,814 --> 00:12:22,815
R3 can't even get the door open.

190
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:27,135
A little late, Stubby.

191
00:12:30,215 --> 00:12:33,975
If you didn't have a lightsaber,
you'd be a dead man.

192
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,421
Where's my droid?

193
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,695
Master, what are you doing?

194
00:12:36,729 --> 00:12:38,135
R2's not here.

195
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:43,256
Let's get out of here.

196
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:47,016
I told you there were
no R2 droids down here.

197
00:12:48,136 --> 00:12:49,856
Look at this mess you made!

198
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:52,336
You owe me, Jedi.

199
00:12:55,016 --> 00:12:58,095
You'll be sorry you ever
came aboard my ship, Jedi.

200
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:01,295
I'm about to make your life miserable.

201
00:13:01,575 --> 00:13:02,822
<i>What is it?</i>

202
00:13:02,855 --> 00:13:05,855
I'm en route to the rendezvous point,
General.

203
00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:08,855
I've got the merchandise
you were looking for.

204
00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:12,942
It must be valuable.

205
00:13:12,976 --> 00:13:15,623
A Jedi came looking for it.

206
00:13:15,656 --> 00:13:19,415
Maybe it is worth more
than we negotiated.

207
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:21,302
<i>Don't push me, slime.</i>

208
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:24,776
<i>You bring that R2 unit to me
as fast as you can get here...</i>

209
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:26,302
<i>...or else...</i>

210
00:13:26,336 --> 00:13:28,936
Ah, yes, of course, General.

211
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,016
Just kidding.

212
00:13:34,176 --> 00:13:37,774
<i>We have to assume that R2 was destroyed
in the explosion that claimed your ship.</i>

213
00:13:38,214 --> 00:13:38,975
Yes, Master.

214
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:40,342
<i>Our intelligence has confirmed</i>

215
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,056
<i>that Grievous' spies have
been intercepting our transmissions.</i>

216
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:46,176
He must have some sort of secret
listening post out there somewhere.

217
00:13:46,536 --> 00:13:48,535
That would explain how he's been
able to ambush our fleets.

218
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,915
<i>Split up your squadrons, Anakin.</i>

219
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:52,902
<i>Find that base and destroy it.</i>

220
00:13:52,936 --> 00:13:54,535
It's as good as done, Master Kenobi.

221
00:13:54,896 --> 00:13:56,575
<i>May the Force be with you both.</i>

222
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:00,702
I'll sweep the outer corridor

223
00:14:00,736 --> 00:14:02,855
while the rest of your ships
focus on the center.

224
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:04,615
Are you sure
you want to go alone?

225
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:07,616
I'm sure. More than one fighter
will just draw too much attention.

226
00:14:07,695 --> 00:14:08,456
Yes, sir.

227
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:11,376
Master, you'll need a droid
to help you navigate.

228
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:13,016
I think Stubby is defective.

229
00:14:13,456 --> 00:14:14,736
Give him another chance, Master.

230
00:14:15,136 --> 00:14:18,975
This is the perfect time for you
and him to, you know, bond.

231
00:14:22,255 --> 00:14:23,055
All right.

232
00:14:24,015 --> 00:14:24,975
Come on, Stubby.

233
00:14:45,856 --> 00:14:47,575
May the Force be with you, Master.

234
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:43,496
Removed your restraining bolt, have you?

235
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,135
What were you up to?

236
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:50,575
R3, have you verified those
coordinates on the search grid?

237
00:15:55,776 --> 00:15:57,096
Okay, let's see what we can find.

238
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,895
Activate long-range scanners.

239
00:16:03,455 --> 00:16:04,655
No, not the tracking beacon!

240
00:16:04,935 --> 00:16:06,616
Shut it down, R3.
Shut it down!

241
00:16:10,776 --> 00:16:12,656
That's Master Skywalker's tracking beacon.

242
00:16:13,016 --> 00:16:13,815
What's he doing?

243
00:16:14,215 --> 00:16:16,335
Rex, get a hold of as many men
as you can.

244
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:17,375
Right away, sir!

245
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,855
There's our Jedi tracking beacon.

246
00:16:26,256 --> 00:16:30,775
Skywalker,
now you have fallen into my trap.

247
00:16:31,175 --> 00:16:32,535
Why do I have to do everything?

248
00:16:35,296 --> 00:16:36,857
Let's hope Grievous didn't hear that.

249
00:16:40,697 --> 00:16:41,897
Yeah, he heard it.

250
00:16:45,535 --> 00:16:46,576
Time to leave.

251
00:16:49,016 --> 00:16:51,215
Plot a course out of here
and prep the hyperdrive engines.

252
00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:56,342
What are you doing?

253
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,894
I said, "prep them",
not, "drop them. "

254
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:07,576
Where's R2 when I need him?

255
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:09,456
Launch everything we have.

256
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,855
Sir, it's only one fighter.
He can't escape.

257
00:17:13,056 --> 00:17:14,095
Everything!

258
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,095
I know, I know! Missiles.

259
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:30,861
I hate missiles.

260
00:17:30,895 --> 00:17:32,415
We're going on the offensive, R3.

261
00:17:32,449 --> 00:17:33,936
Get ready to cut the engines.

262
00:17:35,296 --> 00:17:36,616
Will you just do what I tell you?

263
00:17:42,615 --> 00:17:43,936
Hit the stabilizers, R3.

264
00:17:49,455 --> 00:17:51,136
Hey, that was clever.

265
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,240
Silence!

266
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:55,057
Move the cruisers into attack position.

267
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:57,941
All right, R3.

268
00:17:57,975 --> 00:18:00,256
Let's get turned around
before those fighters catch up to us.

269
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:11,936
You know, if this ship blows up,
you go with it.

270
00:18:14,055 --> 00:18:15,896
What do you mean,
the laser guns won't fire?

271
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:23,902
Cargo bay doors open.
You better get inside.

272
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,215
I'd love to, but R3's having
a problem with the engines.

273
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:36,776
Destroy those ships!
Don't let them get away!

274
00:18:37,577 --> 00:18:39,256
Let's give him some cover, boys.

275
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:40,176
Yes, sir!

276
00:18:47,055 --> 00:18:48,575
Steady. Almost there.

277
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,456
I'm inside.
Now let's get out of here, Ahsoka.

278
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:54,021
Power it up, Rex.

279
00:18:54,054 --> 00:18:56,654
We're going right between those tin cans.

280
00:19:09,855 --> 00:19:10,976
Hit it, Rex.

281
00:19:16,296 --> 00:19:17,897
Uh... they got away, sir.

282
00:19:26,895 --> 00:19:27,701
Hey, Goldie.

283
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:30,056
What did you think of your first adventure?

284
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,136
I'll tell you what I think.

285
00:19:31,456 --> 00:19:32,976
I think I'm lucky to be alive.

286
00:19:36,817 --> 00:19:38,856
Great, now you hurt his feelings.

287
00:19:39,016 --> 00:19:41,095
His feelings?
What about R2?

288
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,752
He's still out there.
I know it.
