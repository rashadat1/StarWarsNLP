1
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:19,312
<i>Hard-pressed Jedi
and their valiant clone troopers</i>

2
00:00:19,432 --> 00:00:22,112
<i>have thwarted an insidious
Separatist plot to plant bombs</i>

3
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:26,192
<i>loaded with the deadly Blue Shadow virus
in key Republic systems.</i>

4
00:00:26,432 --> 00:00:28,591
<i>Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker</i>

5
00:00:28,752 --> 00:00:32,311
<i>have captured the vile scientist
behind the nefarious scheme,</i>

6
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:34,111
<i>Dr. Nuvo Vindi.</i>

7
00:00:34,271 --> 00:00:38,271
<i>Now the Jedi prepare to transport Vindi
to the Republic capital for trial.</i>

8
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:40,031
That was close.

9
00:00:40,151 --> 00:00:43,711
If that virus had escaped,
everyone on Naboo would be dead now.

10
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:47,510
Oh, well. Just another boring day
saving the universe.

11
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:50,511
All right, let's take this sleemo
back to Theed

12
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:53,270
so we can help Padme and Ahsoka
clean up down there.

13
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,990
Senator, you should see this.
It's one of the virus bombs.

14
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,589
It looks like the chamber
that holds the virus is missing.

15
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:09,229
- That droid must have taken it.
- Sound the alarm.

16
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,149
How could droids have gotten ahold
of virus containers?

17
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:18,029
I don't know, but I don't want
to be around when they set it off.

18
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:23,909
We've already taken the virus containers
out of these bombs.

19
00:01:24,029 --> 00:01:25,788
We'll just have to check them again.

20
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:28,509
The virus is liberated.

21
00:01:30,188 --> 00:01:33,108
You are doomed, young Jedi,

22
00:01:33,348 --> 00:01:35,388
along with the rest of the planet.

23
00:01:37,588 --> 00:01:38,548
Hey, you!

24
00:01:39,028 --> 00:01:40,108
Get away from there!

25
00:01:42,188 --> 00:01:43,308
What was that?

26
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:47,027
Virus leak.

27
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,987
Get to the safe room.
Come on!

28
00:02:03,747 --> 00:02:06,067
- There's the safe room!
- No chance!

29
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:08,226
- Hurry! The doors are closing!
- Don't worry.

30
00:02:09,507 --> 00:02:10,626
Get inside, Captain.

31
00:02:12,146 --> 00:02:13,106
Hurry!

32
00:02:18,745 --> 00:02:20,746
Ahsoka, what is going on down there?

33
00:02:20,866 --> 00:02:23,746
<i>The droids released the virus,
but we managed to seal the lab.</i>

34
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:26,545
<i>- And Padme?
- Haven't heard from her since the bomb.</i>

35
00:02:27,225 --> 00:02:28,905
Anakin, can you hear me?

36
00:02:29,305 --> 00:02:31,345
<i>- Anakin?
- Padme, I'm here.</i>

37
00:02:31,905 --> 00:02:34,585
<i>- Are you all right?
- Yes, for the time being.</i>

38
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:37,185
Jar Jar and I were in a safety chamber
when the alarm went off.

39
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:39,265
<i>We're wearing protective suits.</i>

40
00:02:39,385 --> 00:02:42,864
The virus is loose, but Ahsoka
has sealed off the entire facility.

41
00:02:42,985 --> 00:02:45,985
<i>Yes, but any remaining droids
will try to break out.</i>

42
00:02:46,424 --> 00:02:49,664
I'll do what I can to stop them.
I cannot let that virus escape.

43
00:02:50,024 --> 00:02:51,224
Be careful.

44
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,424
Put this on.

45
00:02:57,584 --> 00:03:00,303
Come on, Jar Jar.
We're going to find Ahsoka.

46
00:03:00,423 --> 00:03:02,864
We'll need her help
to find those droids.

47
00:03:05,303 --> 00:03:06,623
Where's the antidote, Vindi?

48
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:10,823
You mistake my role, Jedi.

49
00:03:11,263 --> 00:03:14,463
My job was to manufacture a plague,

50
00:03:14,982 --> 00:03:16,862
not to cure it.

51
00:03:17,422 --> 00:03:19,143
We don't have time for games.

52
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:22,662
Patience, Anakin. There's more
than one way to skin a womp rat.

53
00:03:23,023 --> 00:03:24,342
I said, "where?"

54
00:03:25,742 --> 00:03:29,382
Yes, kill me now
and spare these old bones

55
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:32,022
the Blue Shadow's dire embrace.

56
00:03:32,582 --> 00:03:35,062
Because once the first droid

57
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,341
breaks out of that laboratory,

58
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:40,661
all Naboo is doomed!

59
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,901
The fastest way
to save Senator Amidala and Ahsoka

60
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:48,381
is to get Vindi back to the capital
and find an actual antidote.

61
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,900
Oh, no, no, no.
Some of the virus got in here.

62
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,900
We didn't close the door
fast enough.

63
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:04,180
We may be dead men,
but we could still stop those droids.

64
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,340
Don't worry.

65
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,820
My master will find a cure
for this virus.

66
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,700
<i>- We're not dead yet.
- Is anyone out there?</i>

67
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:13,220
<i>- Can anyone hear...
- Senator Amidala,</i>

68
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,179
we're trapped in the safe room
at the end of complex B.

69
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:17,779
<i>We'll be right there.</i>

70
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:19,819
<i>Are you contaminated?</i>

71
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:23,379
I'm afraid so.

72
00:04:38,938 --> 00:04:41,378
Dr. Vindi,
you'll pay for your treachery.

73
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:42,978
Take him away.

74
00:04:44,657 --> 00:04:48,497
- Now we'll need to find an antidote.
- I think I found an answer for you.

75
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:53,737
So you think you found a cure?

76
00:04:54,137 --> 00:04:57,817
Possibly. A little-known extract
made from reeksa root,

77
00:04:58,217 --> 00:05:00,657
a weed-like vine
found only on Iego,

78
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:02,496
the world of a thousand moons,

79
00:05:02,896 --> 00:05:04,777
deep in Separatist-controlled space.

80
00:05:05,216 --> 00:05:06,176
Let's go.

81
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:10,257
- You must move cautiously if you...
- There's no time for caution!

82
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,576
My padawan is trapped in there,
and so is Padme.

83
00:05:14,136 --> 00:05:15,776
I mean, Senator Amidala.

84
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:19,736
I applaud your courage, General Skywalker,
but it's suicide.

85
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:22,255
Once we contain the virus,
we can send troops.

86
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:24,896
No. Obi-Wan and I
can handle it.

87
00:05:25,336 --> 00:05:26,655
I concur, Anakin.

88
00:05:32,535 --> 00:05:34,175
Padme and Ahsoka will be fine.

89
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,815
They will be
if we succeed.

90
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,775
All the doors are locked.
How are we gonna get out?

91
00:05:45,894 --> 00:05:48,694
- It's not our problem.
- Boy, that's a relief.

92
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:54,894
Senator Amidala,

93
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,974
<i>- where are you?
- We're right outside your safety room.</i>

94
00:05:58,494 --> 00:06:01,493
<i>- Can you get the door open?
- Go ahead, Jar Jar.</i>

95
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:11,013
I'm sorry, Ahsoka.

96
00:06:11,453 --> 00:06:14,772
Don't worry about us, Senator.
We still have a job to do.

97
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:16,692
There aren't very many droids left.

98
00:06:16,812 --> 00:06:19,012
We saw some
heading toward the south entrance.

99
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,212
As long as we're able,

100
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,613
we'll help you destroy those droids
before they breach the compound.

101
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:28,292
You take the north corridor,
and we'll take the south.

102
00:06:30,412 --> 00:06:31,932
The droids are close.

103
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:34,412
I can hear them
cutting through the wall.

104
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:52,411
- Stop!
- Don't open that hatch!

105
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,331
Too late.

106
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,010
There it is.
Iego.

107
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,690
- What do you make of this?
- It looks like a graveyard...

108
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,690
...of ships.

109
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:31,129
Let's go.

110
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:32,329
Anakin...

111
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:41,368
Not good.

112
00:07:44,888 --> 00:07:46,408
Welcome to Iego.

113
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:47,848
Roger, roger.

114
00:07:48,488 --> 00:07:50,087
Anakin, wait.
Wait!

115
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:04,887
Welcome to Iego.

116
00:08:06,006 --> 00:08:07,127
Very impressive.

117
00:08:07,207 --> 00:08:11,047
You just destroyed 17 defenseless battle
droids without suffering a scratch.

118
00:08:11,526 --> 00:08:12,486
Welco...

119
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:14,806
Eighteen, actually.

120
00:08:15,606 --> 00:08:17,367
The venerable Jaybo Hood

121
00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:18,966
requests an audience.

122
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:20,086
- Jaybo?
- Jaybo?

123
00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:21,286
Hey.

124
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:25,205
You guys have any idea how long
it took me to repurpose those droids?

125
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:28,166
- You're Jaybo?
- Well, do you?

126
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,285
I apologize for my friend's
rather rash behavior.

127
00:08:31,365 --> 00:08:34,285
Nine months, man.
It took me nine months.

128
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:42,884
Oh, that's our cue.

129
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:46,285
Channel two.

130
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:57,124
How'd a kid like you
come by this many battle droids anyway?

131
00:08:57,764 --> 00:08:59,844
Simple.
When the Separatists took off,

132
00:09:00,244 --> 00:09:02,564
they left all this junk behind.
I got a whole warehouse

133
00:09:02,724 --> 00:09:06,164
- full of 'em right over there.
- So you programmed them to serve you.

134
00:09:06,883 --> 00:09:08,963
No reason
to let a good droid rust, right?

135
00:09:10,564 --> 00:09:12,243
Looks like you used a...

136
00:09:12,403 --> 00:09:15,723
...macro protocol
to wipe them all simultaneously.

137
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:18,483
- Impressive.
- I see you know your droids.

138
00:09:18,803 --> 00:09:21,602
You're Jedi, aren't you?
You want me to show you how I did it?

139
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:25,923
Perhaps another time.
What we need now is reeksa root.

140
00:09:26,562 --> 00:09:30,002
- Do you know where we can find some?
- Here, there,

141
00:09:30,162 --> 00:09:31,122
everywhere.

142
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:35,922
We don't have time for games, kid.
Where's the root?

143
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:39,722
What my friend is trying to say
is that we are in a bit of a hurry.

144
00:09:40,241 --> 00:09:41,721
Not anymore you're not.

145
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:43,121
Look, you little...

146
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:45,361
This system is haunted, cursed,

147
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:46,481
whatever.

148
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:50,161
Anyway, Jedi or not,
no one gets off this rock alive...

149
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:52,641
not past Droll.

150
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:53,921
Droll!

151
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,441
Droll?

152
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:58,561
Yeah, Droll,

153
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:01,360
the phantom ruler of Iego.

154
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,280
He destroys anything
that leaves the planet.

155
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,680
50 of the best star pilots
in the galaxy have tried.

156
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,240
50 tried...

157
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,880
50 died.

158
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,480
I suppose that explains
the ruined ships in the moonbelt.

159
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:19,520
First things first.
We'll have to deal with this Droll later.

160
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,438
- This-a help.
- Jar Jar, no.

161
00:10:39,198 --> 00:10:39,999
Senator!

162
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,718
Senator,
your suit's been compromised.

163
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:45,838
I'm so sorry.

164
00:10:47,118 --> 00:10:48,238
Don't blame yourself.

165
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,958
These things tend to happen
in a war zone.

166
00:10:58,317 --> 00:11:00,718
- Are you coming?
- You've got to be kidding.

167
00:11:00,797 --> 00:11:02,317
No way I'm going down there.

168
00:11:03,197 --> 00:11:06,157
- You trying to tell us something?
- Don't worry, it's simple.

169
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:09,197
Follow the vines to the bottom,
dig up the roots.

170
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:10,957
But don't touch the vine.

171
00:11:11,277 --> 00:11:13,437
Aside from the obvious, why not?

172
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,836
Because the plants don't like it,

173
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:17,997
and they have big, sharp teeth.

174
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:19,276
Teeth?

175
00:11:19,836 --> 00:11:21,676
This is getting better
by the minute.

176
00:11:21,996 --> 00:11:24,156
And watch out for the flying Xandu.

177
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:26,235
What's a Xandu?

178
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:27,676
I'm not sure.

179
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,596
Master, hop on.

180
00:11:41,115 --> 00:11:42,795
This isn't going to work.

181
00:11:44,795 --> 00:11:46,154
How are you doing up there?

182
00:11:46,394 --> 00:11:47,995
I'm almost through.

183
00:11:48,555 --> 00:11:49,515
There they are.

184
00:11:59,674 --> 00:12:00,554
Ahsoka.

185
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,554
I'm all right.

186
00:12:04,314 --> 00:12:06,794
There! Those are the roots
we're looking for.

187
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:08,714
Oh, poodoo.

188
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:17,753
I have a bad feeling about this.

189
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:21,672
Don't take too long with that.

190
00:12:22,313 --> 00:12:23,992
I'll go as fast as I can.

191
00:12:26,553 --> 00:12:27,913
Anakin, hurry.

192
00:12:29,993 --> 00:12:32,312
- Anakin? Now.
- Okay, okay.

193
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:33,752
Got it.

194
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:39,032
- Hold still.
- We've got to get out of here now.

195
00:13:00,951 --> 00:13:03,510
You made it.
I knew you would.

196
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,030
Oh, did you?

197
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,590
The place dried up
once the spice convoys stopped running.

198
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,550
Out here,

199
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,150
we're just one of the millions
of little backwaters no one cares about.

200
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,590
Those of us who are left

201
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,750
can't leave because of the curse.

202
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,189
Cursed, we are.

203
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,629
The planet is cursed.

204
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,989
Cursed by whom, my twitchy friend?

205
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:31,109
The ghost of Droll, that's who.

206
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:32,469
A ghost?

207
00:13:32,869 --> 00:13:35,349
The spirit of the thousand moons,

208
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:39,109
our protector and destroyer.

209
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:42,389
- It sounds like a load of...
- Superstition?

210
00:13:42,628 --> 00:13:43,988
That's one word for it.

211
00:13:44,308 --> 00:13:46,308
Superstition, you say.

212
00:13:48,148 --> 00:13:49,988
<i>Can't hold on much...</i>

213
00:13:50,228 --> 00:13:51,668
<i>Someone help me!</i>

214
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:54,068
That was Takido.

215
00:13:54,387 --> 00:13:56,068
He was a friend of mine.

216
00:13:56,707 --> 00:13:58,787
Try to leave this planet...

217
00:13:59,187 --> 00:14:02,148
and your fate will be the same.

218
00:14:06,627 --> 00:14:08,227
They'll never make it past Droll.

219
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:15,106
The ghost of Droll
may be a local superstition,

220
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:17,586
but something real
blew up those ships.

221
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,427
"Real" we can handle.

222
00:14:19,906 --> 00:14:20,866
Too bad.

223
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:23,506
<i>- I really liked those guys.
- Thanks for your help, kid.</i>

224
00:14:26,146 --> 00:14:29,426
<i>- We couldn't have done it without you.
- Have you run into Droll yet?</i>

225
00:14:29,826 --> 00:14:31,265
Not to worry, Jaybo.

226
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,425
What's the matter, R2?
Afraid of a ghost?

227
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:43,505
Droll is just a superstition...

228
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:45,185
There's our ghost.

229
00:14:45,505 --> 00:14:46,305
Lasers.

230
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:48,465
We've triggered an energy field.

231
00:14:52,704 --> 00:14:53,384
No.

232
00:14:53,904 --> 00:14:56,784
Turn the ship around.
We'll never make it through.

233
00:15:03,024 --> 00:15:04,944
The Separatists must have
installed those lasers

234
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,783
to prevent people
from leaving the planet.

235
00:15:07,184 --> 00:15:08,624
They're coming back.

236
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:19,103
<i>Master, can you hear me?</i>

237
00:15:19,263 --> 00:15:20,703
R2, amplify the signal.

238
00:15:24,543 --> 00:15:26,783
<i>... destroyed all the battle droids</i>

239
00:15:26,942 --> 00:15:29,182
<i>inside the compound, Master.</i>

240
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,983
<i>Naboo is safe
from further contamination.</i>

241
00:15:32,543 --> 00:15:34,942
<i>I repeat, Naboo is safe.</i>

242
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:40,381
<i>Promise me that no one
will ever open this bunker.</i>

243
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:43,502
<i>Good-bye, Anakin.</i>

244
00:15:44,062 --> 00:15:44,781
<i>I...</i>

245
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:47,421
No!

246
00:15:50,461 --> 00:15:53,101
We'll borrow a power converter from Jaybo
and reprogram it to feed our...

247
00:15:53,262 --> 00:15:55,821
- Slow down, Anakin.
- "Slow down"?

248
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:57,901
You saw them, Master.
They're dying.

249
00:15:58,381 --> 00:16:02,060
A great leap forward often requires
first taking two steps back.

250
00:16:02,381 --> 00:16:05,581
And sometimes all it requires
is the will to jump.

251
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:08,140
At least hear me out on this.

252
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,300
Citizens of Iego,

253
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,540
Droll is not a ghost.

254
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,820
Rather,
it is a Separatist security system.

255
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,260
Nonsense!

256
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,100
You were lucky to escape alive,
simple as that.

257
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:25,740
And who says
we didn't make our own luck?

258
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,939
The ghost of Droll does,
that's who.

259
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,659
Did anyone inhabit Iego's moons
before the Separatists arrived?

260
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,459
- The angels, of course.
- Angels?

261
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:42,538
We were a peaceful people

262
00:16:42,698 --> 00:16:45,099
before the Separatists
drove us from our homes

263
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,459
and stole our moon.

264
00:16:46,938 --> 00:16:48,218
And which moon was that?

265
00:16:49,898 --> 00:16:51,898
Millius Prime.

266
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,018
The primary node,
it must be near Millius Prime.

267
00:16:57,018 --> 00:16:58,778
Vulture droids.
Jaybo,

268
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:00,777
can you reactivate
those vulture droids?

269
00:17:01,098 --> 00:17:03,577
Sure. I can even fly them
by remote control.

270
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:04,698
Good.

271
00:17:04,777 --> 00:17:08,377
We can have R2 fly the vulture droids
as a decoy into the laser field.

272
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,537
And since we know
what we're up against this time,

273
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,497
we can destroy the laser emitter.

274
00:17:12,537 --> 00:17:14,857
And cut a path
right to Millius Prime.

275
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:27,576
What a waste.

276
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:30,296
With all due respect, Senator,

277
00:17:31,136 --> 00:17:32,536
it's what these men were born to do.

278
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:36,536
I hope that their sacrifice
brings us closer to peace.

279
00:17:37,616 --> 00:17:39,335
It will, Padme.

280
00:17:40,535 --> 00:17:43,015
- You must believe that...
- Ahsoka.

281
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:49,815
Ready, General Kenobi.

282
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:51,615
Jaybo, activate the droids.

283
00:17:59,374 --> 00:18:01,654
Transfer control
of the vulture droids to R2.

284
00:18:20,373 --> 00:18:21,893
R2, intercept the lasers.

285
00:18:23,813 --> 00:18:25,973
Send the vulture droids
directly into the laser generator.

286
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:49,971
You guys okay?

287
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:51,652
Guys?

288
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,612
<i>We're fine, kid.</i>

289
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:57,091
I'm afraid you'll need some new droids
to boss around, Jaybo.

290
00:18:57,171 --> 00:18:59,091
The ones you lent us
are pretty much toast.

291
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:02,970
But the good news is

292
00:19:03,131 --> 00:19:05,811
that you're now free to leave Iego
whenever you choose.

293
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,770
R2, set a course for Naboo.

294
00:19:23,689 --> 00:19:24,570
Padme.

295
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:30,930
I spoke with the medical droid.
He expects you to make a full recovery.

296
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,409
I never lost faith in you.

297
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:34,849
None of us did.

298
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:36,289
That's good to hear,

299
00:19:36,449 --> 00:19:39,489
'cause there were a few moments
where we weren't so sure of ourselves.

300
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:41,489
Well, you did make it.

301
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,728
By the way,

302
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:50,368
your padawan was brilliant.

303
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:53,648
I trust I'll see you soon,

304
00:19:54,048 --> 00:19:55,368
General Skywalker?

305
00:19:56,727 --> 00:19:58,688
Of course, my lady.

306
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:08,527
I heard you were quite brave
fending off the battle droids, Jar Jar.

307
00:20:09,807 --> 00:20:10,527
Really?

308
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:13,407
Senator Amidala suggested
we offer you training

309
00:20:13,487 --> 00:20:15,647
to help hone your skills
with a blaster.

310
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:16,727
Really?

311
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:18,487
Really.

312
00:20:18,607 --> 00:20:21,247
Oh, boy.
I'm-a gonna be trained.

313
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:24,046
I am not training him.

314
00:20:26,686 --> 00:20:29,087
You did a fantastic job today,
Snips.

315
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:31,486
All thanks to your training, Master.

316
00:20:31,806 --> 00:20:33,166
Yeah, you're right.

317
00:20:33,406 --> 00:20:35,326
I probably do deserve
most of the credit.

318
00:20:37,485 --> 00:20:38,766
But not all of it.

319
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,365
Good thing...

320
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:44,365
I know you don't mean
