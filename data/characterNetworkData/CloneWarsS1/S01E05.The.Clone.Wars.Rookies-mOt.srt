1
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,784
<i>Clone forces rally!</i>

2
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:21,743
<i>As the war escalates
in the Outer Rim,</i>

3
00:00:21,824 --> 00:00:24,463
<i>the Jedi knights
are spread thinly across the galaxy.</i>

4
00:00:25,423 --> 00:00:29,262
<i>Many new clones are rushed into service
to support their Jedi generals.</i>

5
00:00:29,422 --> 00:00:32,301
<i>Unfortunately, because of
the relentless demands of battle,</i>

6
00:00:32,382 --> 00:00:34,461
<i>many young clones
must join the struggle</i>

7
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:37,181
<i>before their intensive training
has been completed.</i>

8
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:40,220
<i>These clones, manning
a vital network of tracking stations,</i>

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,659
<i>are all that stand
between the Republic and invasion.</i>

10
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:53,898
This is the deck officer checking in.
Nothing going on.

11
00:00:54,697 --> 00:00:55,657
<i>As usual.</i>

12
00:00:56,537 --> 00:00:59,576
<i>You're listening to the grand army
of the Republic broadcast,</i>

13
00:00:59,736 --> 00:01:01,576
<i>the voice of the Outer Rim.</i>

14
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:05,335
<i>This next one goes out
to the med-jumpers of the 224th.</i>

15
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:07,175
<i>"Smugging it out on Membom. "</i>

16
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:10,134
<i>Keep your heads down
and your seals tight, boys.</i>

17
00:01:12,854 --> 00:01:13,574
Yes!

18
00:01:14,894 --> 00:01:16,213
Who's next? Fives?

19
00:01:17,013 --> 00:01:19,093
Shouldn't you be
watching your scope, Hevy?

20
00:01:19,172 --> 00:01:20,373
Let's take a look.

21
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,572
What do you know, all clear.

22
00:01:23,732 --> 00:01:25,812
Just like the last hundred times
I looked at it.

23
00:01:26,132 --> 00:01:28,371
Personally,
I like that it's so quiet out here.

24
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:29,971
I can catch up on the rig manuals.

25
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:31,970
Echo, what is wrong with you?

26
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,850
We should be out on the front lines,
blasting droids.

27
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,729
Leave him alone. They kept him
in his girl's chart too long.

28
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:39,009
Yeah.

29
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:42,528
You may not realize it yet, Fives,

30
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:46,047
but you landed on the most boring post
in the Outer Rim.

31
00:01:46,447 --> 00:01:48,048
And one of the most important.

32
00:01:50,447 --> 00:01:52,206
Attention! Sergeant on deck!

33
00:01:53,407 --> 00:01:54,606
At ease!

34
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:57,325
Even though you're all new here,
I shouldn't have to remind you

35
00:01:57,486 --> 00:01:59,565
that this quadrant is
key to the Outer Rim.

36
00:01:59,805 --> 00:02:03,405
If the droids get past this station,
they can surprise-attack the facilities

37
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:05,884
where we were born
on our home world of Kamino.

38
00:02:06,364 --> 00:02:07,964
There are some officers on the way,

39
00:02:08,123 --> 00:02:10,523
so I want everything squared away
for inspection.

40
00:02:10,843 --> 00:02:12,522
- Understood?
- Sir, yes, sir!

41
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,836
Still here, Anakin.

42
00:02:29,077 --> 00:02:30,837
When was the last time you slept?

43
00:02:30,957 --> 00:02:33,076
I'll sleep
after we find General Grievous.

44
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:36,036
Clone intelligence spotted him
in the Balmorra system.

45
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:37,475
That was weeks ago.

46
00:02:37,555 --> 00:02:38,995
Since then, he vanished.

47
00:02:39,155 --> 00:02:42,674
Well, unlike you, maybe he's
getting some much-needed rest.

48
00:02:45,194 --> 00:02:48,353
Excuse me, General. Incoming
transmission from Commander Cody.

49
00:02:49,793 --> 00:02:51,233
<i>General Kenobi, General Skywalker.</i>

50
00:02:51,553 --> 00:02:53,392
Cody.
How goes the inspections?

51
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:56,111
<i>The tracking station in Pastil
is fully operational.</i>

52
00:02:56,271 --> 00:02:59,151
<i>Captain Rex and I are proceeding
to the outpost in the Rishi system.</i>

53
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:01,470
Good.
Report back once you've arrived.

54
00:03:01,551 --> 00:03:02,351
<i>Copy that.</i>

55
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:03,471
<i>Cody out.</i>

56
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,990
Good man, that Cody.
Don't worry, Anakin.

57
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,909
If General Grievous comes anywhere near
this quadrant, we'll know about it.

58
00:03:16,348 --> 00:03:18,828
- Sir, incoming meteor shower.
- Raise the shield.

59
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:23,306
You wanted excitement, Hevy.

60
00:03:23,387 --> 00:03:24,347
Right.

61
00:03:25,386 --> 00:03:26,666
Meteor shower.

62
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:50,852
What the...?

63
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:10,448
- Get these doors open.
- Roger, roger.

64
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:15,724
CT-327, report in.

65
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,923
- Sentry, do you copy?
- Interference from the meteors?

66
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:22,123
- I don't see him down there, Sarge.
- You two, go find him.

67
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:29,802
Droids!

68
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,840
Sound the alarm!

69
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,999
They've disabled the beacon.

70
00:04:47,878 --> 00:04:50,278
Get a message to the fleet!
We have to warn...

71
00:04:53,318 --> 00:04:54,037
Sarge!

72
00:05:02,356 --> 00:05:03,955
That should slow those buckets down.

73
00:05:06,195 --> 00:05:08,675
- This way. Hurry!
- No, we can...

74
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:10,753
There's too many.

75
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:27,534
Four clones escaped, Captain.

76
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:28,974
They don't matter.

77
00:05:29,071 --> 00:05:33,290
Hard-wire the all-clear signal
and contact General Grievous.

78
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:41,009
<i>The outpost is secure, General.</i>

79
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:44,929
<i>We shut down the alarm
and turned on the all-clear signal.</i>

80
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:46,048
Excellent.

81
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,728
Keep that signal alive.

82
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,727
I don't want the Republic
to find out we're coming.

83
00:05:51,888 --> 00:05:54,607
General, our spy on Kamino
is making contact.

84
00:05:55,407 --> 00:05:57,326
<i>All the preparations
for your invasion</i>

85
00:05:57,486 --> 00:05:58,686
<i>are in order.</i>

86
00:05:59,006 --> 00:05:59,966
Good.

87
00:06:00,606 --> 00:06:02,766
Our fleet is approaching the system.

88
00:06:03,006 --> 00:06:05,725
We are almost
at the rendezvous point.

89
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,484
<i>Very good, my lord.</i>

90
00:06:08,205 --> 00:06:09,724
<i>I will await your arrival.</i>

91
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,204
The destruction of Kamino

92
00:06:12,284 --> 00:06:16,043
will stop their production of clones
for good.

93
00:06:20,682 --> 00:06:23,322
Rishi outpost, this is Commander Cody.
Do you copy?

94
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:25,561
<i>Rishi outpost, please respond.</i>

95
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:28,600
Open...
Open...

96
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:30,520
Open comlink channel.

97
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,440
Rishi outpost, come in.

98
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,520
Rishi outpost, come in.

99
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,959
<i>Sorry, Commander.</i>

100
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:39,398
<i>We're experiencing
technical difficulties.</i>

101
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,318
This is the inspection team.

102
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:43,797
<i>Inspection?
Negative, negative.</i>

103
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,437
<i>We do not require an inspection.</i>

104
00:06:46,597 --> 00:06:48,436
<i>Everything is fine here.
Thank you.</i>

105
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:51,636
We'll be the judge of that.
Prepare for our arrival.

106
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:53,316
<i>Roger, roger.</i>

107
00:06:54,516 --> 00:06:56,356
Something's not right here.

108
00:06:57,155 --> 00:06:59,795
Well, good luck.
I'm putting you in charge of this one.

109
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,270
What do we do without the sarge?

110
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:26,830
- The reg manual says the next...
- Wait. Wait.

111
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,109
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, what is that?

112
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,188
It doesn't sound like droids.

113
00:07:35,308 --> 00:07:37,468
Don't forget about those giant eels.

114
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:39,148
I've never seen...

115
00:07:40,747 --> 00:07:41,707
Cutup!

116
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,265
What the hell was that?!

117
00:07:48,505 --> 00:07:49,706
That was an eel.

118
00:07:49,866 --> 00:07:52,425
Now, that's why we have the regulation
not to go outside.

119
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:54,584
Let's move before it comes back.

120
00:07:54,744 --> 00:07:55,864
Poor Cutup.

121
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,104
Look! It's Commander Cody.

122
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:01,943
It's the inspection team.

123
00:08:13,781 --> 00:08:16,980
This is not good.
I don't see the deck officer anywhere.

124
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,620
These boys are sloppy.

125
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:22,259
There should always be
an officer on duty.

126
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:25,779
We have to warn them.
Get on the comlink.

127
00:08:29,618 --> 00:08:31,938
I have a bad feeling about this.

128
00:08:32,257 --> 00:08:34,017
Welcome to Rishi, Commander.

129
00:08:34,177 --> 00:08:37,536
As you can see, the outpost is
operating at peak efficiency.

130
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,976
Thank you for visiting,
and have a safe trip back.

131
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,135
We need to inspect the base
just the same.

132
00:08:46,254 --> 00:08:47,614
There is no need.

133
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:50,094
Everything is fine
and fully operational.

134
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,853
It's no good. Their comlinks
are on a different scramble set.

135
00:08:57,932 --> 00:08:59,612
I'll signal them with this flare.

136
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,612
Take us to the sergeant in command.

137
00:09:02,172 --> 00:09:03,291
Roger, roger.

138
00:09:06,051 --> 00:09:07,531
A droid attack flare?

139
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:10,730
Rex!
What the heck are you doing?

140
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,770
Relax.

141
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,889
Just as I thought.

142
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:18,328
Looks like one of those
new commando droids.

143
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:20,728
That flare must have come
from the survivors.

144
00:09:22,488 --> 00:09:23,448
Ambush!

145
00:09:32,997 --> 00:09:34,997
Those clankers have tough armor.

146
00:09:42,265 --> 00:09:43,426
We're cut off.

147
00:09:47,425 --> 00:09:48,672
Off the platform!

148
00:09:50,144 --> 00:09:51,144
Copy that.

149
00:10:02,422 --> 00:10:05,422
No sign of them.
They must have been pulverized.

150
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:07,821
Resume defensive posts.

151
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,818
Well, that sure complicates things,
Commander.

152
00:10:21,898 --> 00:10:25,258
- No worse than that time on Tibrin.
- We had Jedi with us on Tibrin.

153
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:26,418
They helped.

154
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:32,857
Hands above your heads.
Take your sun bonnets off.

155
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,176
- Sir?
- Take 'em off! Now!

156
00:10:49,413 --> 00:10:50,373
Nice shot.

157
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:51,812
The name's Rex.

158
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:54,933
But you'll call me "Captain",
or "sir".

159
00:10:55,332 --> 00:10:56,532
Sir, yes, sir!

160
00:10:57,332 --> 00:10:59,491
I'm Commander Cody, your new boss.

161
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:02,930
My designation is trooper 27-5555, sir.

162
00:11:03,251 --> 00:11:05,170
We call him Fives.
I'm Hevy.

163
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:06,610
This is Echo.

164
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,370
Where's your sergeant?

165
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:10,690
Dead, sir.
We're all that's left.

166
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:13,809
Looks like we got ourselves
a batch of shinies, Commander.

167
00:11:14,568 --> 00:11:16,609
- Shinies, sir?
- That's right.

168
00:11:17,088 --> 00:11:19,087
Your armor, it's shiny and new...

169
00:11:19,407 --> 00:11:20,527
just like you.

170
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:22,527
Sir,

171
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:25,006
me and my batchers
are trained and ready.

172
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:27,486
We'll take back our post,
shiny or not.

173
00:11:28,046 --> 00:11:29,726
There's hope for you yet, rookie.

174
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:35,789
Commander Cody, do you copy?

175
00:11:36,748 --> 00:11:38,428
Captain Rex, please respond.

176
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:41,708
They should have checked in
from the Rishi station hours ago.

177
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,507
It appears your captain follows orders
as well as you do.

178
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:48,682
Perhaps Cody is boring Rex
with standard procedures and protocol.

179
00:11:49,082 --> 00:11:51,721
We need to work on our own
boring procedures

180
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:54,201
and figure out a strategy
to find Grievous.

181
00:11:54,841 --> 00:11:57,800
Right. Admiral, let me know
if you hear from Rex.

182
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:05,799
Look sharp, rookies.

183
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,958
As long as those tweezers
occupy this post,

184
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:10,358
our home planet of Kamino
is at risk.

185
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:13,638
- But there's so many of them.
- Doesn't matter, kid.

186
00:12:13,717 --> 00:12:17,236
We have to retake this base,
so we will retake this base.

187
00:12:19,557 --> 00:12:23,076
How do you propose we get through
those blast doors, Rex, old boy?

188
00:12:23,155 --> 00:12:24,995
I have a few ideas.

189
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,634
What is that?

190
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,953
Unit 2-6, is that you?

191
00:12:38,512 --> 00:12:39,553
<i>Roger, roger.</i>

192
00:12:40,032 --> 00:12:41,392
You sound strange.

193
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:43,632
Is something wrong
with your vocabulator?

194
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:47,071
- Roger, roger.
- Take off your helmet.

195
00:12:47,151 --> 00:12:48,751
Let me see your faceplate.

196
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,671
<i>Roger, roger.</i>

197
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,270
This is never gonna work.

198
00:13:00,109 --> 00:13:01,868
- Clones!
- Roger, roger.

199
00:13:04,508 --> 00:13:05,787
Right. Let's move.

200
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:13,894
- Permission to take point, sir?
- I'm always first, kid.

201
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:26,213
- Fives!
- He's okay. Focus on the battle.

202
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,131
I got one!

203
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,489
- Sorry, Echo. I jumped that one.
- Like hell you did.

204
00:13:45,134 --> 00:13:48,011
Not so tough now,
are ya, Sparky?

205
00:13:50,044 --> 00:13:51,164
Get to the window.

206
00:13:51,244 --> 00:13:53,484
It looks like we have
more visitors.

207
00:13:58,762 --> 00:14:00,842
It looks like a Separatist fleet.

208
00:14:03,482 --> 00:14:05,481
That's why they commandeered
the outpost.

209
00:14:05,562 --> 00:14:07,481
They're mounting
a full-scale invasion.

210
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:09,241
We have to warn command.

211
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,880
The Republic base is still transmitting
the all-clear signal,

212
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:17,079
but for some reason, our commando
droids are not responding.

213
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,382
We can leave nothing to chance.

214
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:23,268
That base cannot be allowed
to alert the Jedi that we're coming.

215
00:14:23,987 --> 00:14:26,547
Send down reinforcements
to investigate.

216
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,306
Those clankers sabotaged
our transmitter,

217
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:32,946
and they hard-wired the all-clear signal.
It'll take time to repair.

218
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,945
- We don't have time.
- Look.

219
00:14:40,624 --> 00:14:44,224
Well, buddy, you always said
you wanted to be on the front lines.

220
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,219
We can't protect the outpost long
against that army of clankers.

221
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,299
Then we'll destroy the outpost instead.

222
00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:13,538
But, sir, our mission is to defend
this facility at all costs.

223
00:15:13,698 --> 00:15:16,058
We have to warn the Republic
about the invasion.

224
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:18,417
They'll take notice
when the all-clear signal stops.

225
00:15:18,857 --> 00:15:19,857
That's right.

226
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:22,097
When they stop receiving our beacon,

227
00:15:22,217 --> 00:15:24,096
they'll get the message
something's wrong.

228
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:26,456
We'll need every thermal detonator
in the inventory.

229
00:15:26,535 --> 00:15:29,575
It'll take more than a few detonators
to destroy this outpost.

230
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,055
We can use the LT.

231
00:15:31,174 --> 00:15:33,374
This moon freezes
for over half the year.

232
00:15:33,414 --> 00:15:35,894
We use liquid tibanna as fuel
to heat the base.

233
00:15:36,054 --> 00:15:39,173
- Liquid tibanna... highly explosive.
- Good.

234
00:15:39,573 --> 00:15:42,053
Bring the tanks here
and prime the detonators.

235
00:15:50,531 --> 00:15:51,651
All right, listen up.

236
00:15:51,811 --> 00:15:55,090
There's only one target of interest
in this sector: Kamino.

237
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,330
It's the closest thing
we clones have to a home.

238
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,329
Today we fight
for more than the Republic.

239
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,809
Today we fight for all our brothers
back home.

240
00:16:01,969 --> 00:16:03,808
- Understood?
- Sir, yes, sir!

241
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:13,807
I think we can even the odds a bit,
Commander,

242
00:16:13,966 --> 00:16:16,046
especially since they don't know
we're here.

243
00:16:16,206 --> 00:16:17,647
This one here is mine.

244
00:16:18,606 --> 00:16:20,606
Big gun doesn't make a big man.

245
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,044
- Reinforcements reporting.
- Open up.

246
00:16:31,484 --> 00:16:33,083
Didn't say "please. "

247
00:16:35,243 --> 00:16:36,602
Clones! Get 'em!

248
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:47,401
We could use a Jedi about now.

249
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,160
Captain Rex, come in.

250
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:55,159
Commander Cody, are you there?

251
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,039
General, there's still no response.

252
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:01,878
How about the all-clear signal?
Is the base still transmitting?

253
00:17:01,957 --> 00:17:02,838
Yes, sir.

254
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:05,317
If something were wrong,
Cody would contact us.

255
00:17:05,477 --> 00:17:07,077
What is the status of the base?

256
00:17:08,276 --> 00:17:10,196
We've run into some difficulties.

257
00:17:10,277 --> 00:17:12,596
There seem to be
a few clones left, sir.

258
00:17:12,676 --> 00:17:14,116
Then wipe them out.

259
00:17:14,276 --> 00:17:17,235
We can't let a few puny clones
stop us.

260
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:26,207
Fall back to the op center.
Move!

261
00:17:31,645 --> 00:17:34,124
<i>- Rex, time's wasting.
- Almost ready.</i>

262
00:17:36,363 --> 00:17:39,163
The handset isn't linking up
with the detonator.

263
00:17:40,256 --> 00:17:41,655
- Hevy.
- Yes, sir.

264
00:17:41,815 --> 00:17:43,895
- This detonator isn't working.
- I'll take care of it.

265
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:46,119
It'll be fixed in no time.
You guys get out of here.

266
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:49,158
Just make it fast.
Those droids are getting close.

267
00:17:55,237 --> 00:17:57,476
There.
That should fix it.

268
00:18:02,276 --> 00:18:03,515
This isn't good.

269
00:18:04,036 --> 00:18:05,956
There's got to be another way.

270
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,000
The base is ours again, sir.

271
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:24,079
- The clones are fleeing.
- Cowards.

272
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,119
Secure the area.

273
00:18:31,103 --> 00:18:32,462
Hevy, hit the...

274
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:34,462
<i>- Where's Hevy?
- I'm on it, sir.</i>

275
00:18:35,022 --> 00:18:36,781
Hevy, get out of there.

276
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:39,500
The remote isn't working.
I have to detonate it manually.

277
00:18:39,821 --> 00:18:41,900
Hold on there.
Blast him!

278
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,419
We've got to get up there.
Back to the maintenance pipe.

279
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,059
- Let's move.
- It's no use. I know what I have to do.

280
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:51,898
I don't like your tone, rookie.

281
00:18:57,258 --> 00:18:58,377
<i>Soldier, come in.</i>

282
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,657
<i>Are you there?</i>

283
00:19:06,456 --> 00:19:09,399
<i>Soldier, come in!
Respond!</i>

284
00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:11,030
<i>Talk to us!</i>

285
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:29,026
Hevy, come in.
Come in, Hevy!

286
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:30,944
<i>Hevy, come in!</i>

287
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,945
Do we take prisoners?

288
00:19:35,744 --> 00:19:36,784
I don't.

289
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:55,212
Hevy always did hate that place.

290
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,939
The all-clear signal
has been disabled?

291
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,779
The Rishi base has
stopped transmitting.

292
00:20:03,124 --> 00:20:05,403
- Grievous.
- Sound the invasion alarm.

293
00:20:05,563 --> 00:20:07,402
Let's get the fleet under way.

294
00:20:09,882 --> 00:20:12,361
I didn't tell them
to blow up the station.

295
00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:14,920
But isn't it good
that the base is destroyed?

296
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:15,961
Idiot!

297
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:19,000
The Republic fleet.

298
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,360
We're outgunned.
Get us out of here.

299
00:20:31,718 --> 00:20:33,558
We've got those tinnies on the run.

300
00:20:33,637 --> 00:20:34,877
Thanks to Hevy.

301
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:36,181
Gunships.

302
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,004
Getting off this crater, boys.

303
00:20:54,964 --> 00:20:56,484
On behalf of the Republic,

304
00:20:56,499 --> 00:20:58,698
we thank you
for your valiant service,

305
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:01,258
and we honor
your comrade's sacrifice.

306
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:04,737
Your new unit is lucky to have you.

307
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:08,296
I'd be proud to fight
beside you anytime, anywhere.

308
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:14,055
Congratulations.

309
00:21:14,295 --> 00:21:16,055
You're not shinies anymore.

310
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:20,214
With all due respect, sir,
we failed our mission.

311
00:21:20,374 --> 00:21:22,014
We don't deserve this honor.

312
00:21:22,134 --> 00:21:25,413
No. If it weren't for you,
the Republic wouldn't have learned

313
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:28,133
of the Separatists' invasion
until it was too late.

314
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:29,972
You showed me something today.

315
00:21:30,252 --> 00:21:33,371
You're exactly the kind of men
I need in the 501st.

316
00:21:34,012 --> 00:21:35,331
Sir, yes, sir!
