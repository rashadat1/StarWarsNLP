1
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:19,574
<i>The clone war threatens
the unity of the Republic.</i>

2
00:00:19,694 --> 00:00:21,774
<i>As battles rage across the galaxy,</i>

3
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:24,695
<i>more worlds succumb
to the seductive lure of the Separatists</i>

4
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:26,215
<i>and leave the Republic.</i>

5
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:27,654
<i>On a vital mission of peace,</i>

6
00:00:28,015 --> 00:00:31,575
<i>Senator Padme Amidala journeys
to the Outer Rim world of Rodia,</i>

7
00:00:31,695 --> 00:00:34,334
<i>desperate to ensure
its loyalty remains to the Republic.</i>

8
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:36,375
<i>Senator Amidala,</i>

9
00:00:36,574 --> 00:00:39,615
<i>I just received word that you have
ventured through enemy territory</i>

10
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:40,735
<i>into the Outer Rim.</i>

11
00:00:41,135 --> 00:00:43,935
Senator Farr requested me personally,
Chancellor.

12
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:47,094
His planet is in crisis.
His people are starving.

13
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:50,575
He's a very old family friend.
I could not refuse his plea for help.

14
00:00:50,814 --> 00:00:52,095
<i>I understand,</i>

15
00:00:52,215 --> 00:00:55,734
<i>but in these dangerous times, you should
be accompanied by a clone escort.</i>

16
00:00:56,095 --> 00:00:57,735
This is a mission of peace.

17
00:00:57,855 --> 00:00:59,775
I put my faith in diplomacy.

18
00:01:00,055 --> 00:01:02,815
We can't solve all of our problems
by throwing troops at them.

19
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:05,214
Yousa no needing to worry,
Chancellor.

20
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:07,415
- As resempative of Nab...
- Jar Jar, look out!

21
00:01:18,895 --> 00:01:19,855
What is happening?

22
00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:22,255
<i>May I recommend
that only those who are qualified</i>

23
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,135
<i>for these delicate peace talks
participate in them?</i>

24
00:01:28,095 --> 00:01:30,935
I will follow your advice, Chancellor.
Thank you.

25
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:50,535
Lookee, lookee, it's a swamp planet
just like home. Meesa have to get going.

26
00:01:50,895 --> 00:01:54,696
Jar Jar, you would be doing me
a great favor by staying with the ship.

27
00:01:55,735 --> 00:01:58,376
Meesa knowing meesa be big help
with the negotiations.

28
00:01:58,695 --> 00:02:00,255
I need you to watch over 3PO.

29
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:03,015
You know how he always
gets himself into trouble.

30
00:02:03,135 --> 00:02:05,096
Trouble, me?
Really.

31
00:02:05,536 --> 00:02:06,535
I won't be long.

32
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:09,376
Meesa understands, My Lady.

33
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:13,336
His Excellency, Ah-Twa.

34
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,095
I've missed you so much.

35
00:02:31,215 --> 00:02:33,176
I was afraid you might not come.

36
00:02:33,776 --> 00:02:36,295
We are such a small
and humble system.

37
00:02:37,136 --> 00:02:39,376
Uncle Ono,
you are very important to me.

38
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:41,816
We've been friends
since I was a little girl,

39
00:02:41,936 --> 00:02:44,416
when you were my father's
strongest ally in the Senate.

40
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:46,816
Rodia is very important
to the Republic,

41
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:48,816
and of course I'd come to help you.

42
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:52,055
You speak of friendship
I have not witnessed of late.

43
00:02:52,296 --> 00:02:55,967
Where was the Republic when our
supply ships were destroyed by pirates?

44
00:02:56,575 --> 00:02:59,176
Where was the Republic
as my people starved?

45
00:02:59,536 --> 00:03:02,296
We have been stranded out here

46
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,616
without any help at all.

47
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:08,296
I know it is not your fault,
but my people starve

48
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,536
all the same.

49
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:12,416
I'm sure the Republic Senate
will approve a relief effort.

50
00:03:12,536 --> 00:03:15,896
The vote was postponed,
but you will get your food.

51
00:03:16,457 --> 00:03:18,296
I am sorry.

52
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:20,297
It is too late, my sweet.

53
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:24,336
The Separatist leader Nute Gunray
has promised to support us

54
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:27,417
with a very generous relief effort.

55
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:34,257
He is giving us food, ships,
and protection.

56
00:03:34,616 --> 00:03:37,256
Nute Gunray cannot be trusted.

57
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:40,616
He will bring war to your system
just as he did to mine many years ago.

58
00:03:40,896 --> 00:03:42,097
I am afraid

59
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:45,176
I have already done
what I must for my people.

60
00:03:53,057 --> 00:03:54,736
Viceroy, I should have known.

61
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:57,336
<i>You won't get away this time,
Senator.</i>

62
00:03:57,536 --> 00:03:59,457
<i>Your friend made a deal with me,</i>

63
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:01,417
<i>and you are part of it.</i>

64
00:04:01,896 --> 00:04:03,617
3PO! Come in, 3PO.

65
00:04:03,936 --> 00:04:05,576
<i>- Stop her!
- Three...</i>

66
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:08,497
<i>No one can help you now.</i>

67
00:04:09,176 --> 00:04:12,736
I am so sorry, my sweet.
I had no choice.

68
00:04:12,897 --> 00:04:14,376
There's always a choice.

69
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:17,217
<i>- To live in fear is no life at all.
- Take her away.</i>

70
00:04:17,776 --> 00:04:20,457
Please, Uncle Ono,
don't do this.

71
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:23,217
<i>You have made a wise decision,
Senator.</i>

72
00:04:23,617 --> 00:04:27,457
<i>I will be there within the hour
to bring food for your people...</i>

73
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:29,937
<i>...and collect my prize.</i>

74
00:04:34,737 --> 00:04:35,737
How rude.

75
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:39,697
I'm afraid the local swamp life
doesn't have a very high opinion of us.

76
00:04:39,977 --> 00:04:42,377
- Whaten dey speaking?
- I couldn't possibly repeat it.

77
00:04:43,137 --> 00:04:44,977
Theesa swamp dwellers
just like meesa.

78
00:04:45,097 --> 00:04:47,537
I will convince them
of our good fellowship.

79
00:04:47,657 --> 00:04:49,017
Do be careful, Jar Jar.

80
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:51,657
I don't think they're quite
like your friends on Naboo.

81
00:05:03,578 --> 00:05:04,737
Meesa make contact.

82
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:06,097
Oh, dear.

83
00:05:14,657 --> 00:05:16,458
I don't think
that requires translation.

84
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:22,537
Thisen is a different
swamp altogether. Sorry.

85
00:05:24,897 --> 00:05:27,018
Oh, my stars. Battle droids.

86
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:28,617
Weesa in trouble now.

87
00:05:29,017 --> 00:05:30,497
Stop where you are.

88
00:05:32,017 --> 00:05:33,018
Wait for me!

89
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:40,537
Jar Jar, you great webfoot,
you're squashing my circuits.

90
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:42,137
Blast 'em.

91
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:44,737
Wait, where are you going?

92
00:05:49,738 --> 00:05:51,378
Oh, no. I'll be crushed for sure.

93
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:53,778
- Hang on, Three-so!
- It's 3PO.

94
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:57,698
That was close.

95
00:06:01,617 --> 00:06:03,778
What are you doing?
Get me down at once.

96
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:17,498
It's not too late.

97
00:06:17,618 --> 00:06:20,298
Uncle Ono,
you can stop this madness.

98
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:21,978
Keep moving, prisoner.

99
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:28,498
Look out, Jar Jar.
A crab droid is headed right for you.

100
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:30,178
Headed for meesa?

101
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:32,058
Yes, yousa!

102
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,978
No, Jar Jar, go to your left.

103
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:38,219
Behind you.

104
00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:45,018
Watch out.

105
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:47,139
I can't bear to watch.

106
00:06:50,496 --> 00:06:51,551
Jar Jar!

107
00:06:52,818 --> 00:06:55,219
Oh, no. Jar Jar's been killed.

108
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:58,018
I knew something like this
would happen.

109
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:04,298
What a horrible way to die,
and it's all my fault.

110
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:05,619
He was so brave.

111
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:08,058
Now he's gone forever.

112
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:10,859
Meesa okay.

113
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:12,858
Jar Jar, you're alive.

114
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,058
Meesa okay, Three-so.

115
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:16,418
Meesa okay.

116
00:07:17,618 --> 00:07:20,498
If you've finished messing around,
I need help.

117
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,819
- Jar Jar, kindly don't do that.
- But meesa save-ed you.

118
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:37,299
That's the end of our ship.
Typical.

119
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,379
Are those chains necessary?

120
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,219
Welcome to the Separatist way,
Senator.

121
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:51,218
Viceroy Gunray's orders.

122
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:54,739
I hope it's worth it to you.

123
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:57,099
Thisa one big mess.

124
00:07:57,299 --> 00:07:58,979
Weesa going nowhere.

125
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,259
Perhaps we should try to
contact the clone troopers.

126
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:05,979
Lookee. Here's a button
that's still working.

127
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:10,019
What did you break now?

128
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:11,459
Meesa doing nothing.

129
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:13,899
Thatsa looken like a Jedi robe.

130
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:16,099
Whosa you supos'n this belongs to?

131
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:18,259
I wouldn't know.

132
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:20,939
But our only hope is
to hide in this closet

133
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:23,020
until Mistress Padme returns.

134
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:24,859
If those droids attacking us,

135
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:26,619
Padme's probably in trouble.

136
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:29,379
My Lady gave us
very specific instructions

137
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:30,739
to remain here.

138
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,819
Fiddlesticks.
We musta hafta try and saving her.

139
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,379
Jar Jar Binks,
have you gone completely mad?

140
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:38,380
You'll do more harm than good.

141
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,620
Good. I shall meet the viceroy
when he lands.

142
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,739
What about
Senator Amidala's companions?

143
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:54,499
If there are no signs
of her friends,

144
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:56,700
they must have fled into the jungle.

145
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:58,579
Yes, this is perfect.

146
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,700
I want no sign of trouble.

147
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,780
Our people need those supplies.

148
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,940
Wait.
Meesa eyeball's stuck in the sleeve.

149
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,019
- Just look at you.
- Something's wrongo here.

150
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:12,900
The battle droids will surely
capture you, or worse, me.

151
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,100
Not with thisa on.
Theysa won't be recognizing me.

152
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,100
- You can't be serious.
- Come on, Three-so.

153
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,500
- We can do it.
- I have a very bad feeling about this.

154
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,540
The citizens of Rodia
welcome you, Viceroy.

155
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,780
Where is Senator Amidala?

156
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,660
Awaiting your arrival as promised.

157
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,940
Excellent.

158
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,300
I do not wish to keep her waiting.

159
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,420
Shall we go?

160
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,940
We are holding the senator
in the detention tower.

161
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,900
I hope it is not too painful
for her.

162
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,660
Sheesa up in that tower?
Weesa got to rescuing her.

163
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,660
And how precisely
do you propose to do that?

164
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,261
Look, a Jedi.

165
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,740
We're doomed.

166
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,141
- A Jedi?
- Jedi?

167
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,700
Where's a Jedi?

168
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,340
I do believe they mean you.

169
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,820
- Meesa not a Jedi.
- Kill the Jedi.

170
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,268
Don't shoot. We surrender.
We surrender!

171
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,740
Forget surrender!
Weesa run!

172
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,495
Jar Jar!

173
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:32,501
- Is he dead?
- The Jedi got away.

174
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:35,540
He slipped through this grate
and went underwater.

175
00:10:42,061 --> 00:10:43,301
Sound the alarm!

176
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:44,541
Find that Jedi!

177
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,620
I can see you're busy,
so I'll just be going now.

178
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,501
And take that Republic droid scum
to the dismantling center.

179
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,701
Dismantling center?
Wait, wait. I'm innocent.

180
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,820
I'm innocent, I tell you.

181
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,501
Let's find that Jedi.

182
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:16,621
- Roger, roger.
- Roger, roger.

183
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:19,821
Take me to Senator Amidala at once!

184
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,582
There's a bad boogie monster down there,
you betcha.

185
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:36,541
Don't be fearing, Padme.
Meesa coming.

186
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:43,901
Better watch out.
There's a Jedi on the loose.

187
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:47,861
You know,
you will soon be destroyed.

188
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:50,301
I can't tell you how many times
I've seen battle droids

189
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,221
sliced in half by a lone Jedi.

190
00:11:52,901 --> 00:11:55,421
Quiet, you.
All right, cut the chatter.

191
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,381
I want you troops to go outside
and secure the perimeter.

192
00:11:58,581 --> 00:12:01,061
You made it. I'm rescued at last.

193
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:04,461
Hurry, before the battle droids
figure out what's happening.

194
00:12:06,982 --> 00:12:08,941
- Quiet in there!
- Thank you.

195
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:11,581
Let's get out of here, Master Jedi.

196
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:12,781
Jedi?

197
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,741
There's no Jedi in here.

198
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:20,061
Wait, there's no prisoner in here.

199
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:21,741
How did she do that?

200
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:27,782
Where's the alarm button?

201
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:43,542
I am a protocol droid...

202
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:46,502
- fluent in over 6 million forms of...
- Quiet.

203
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:53,582
3PO.

204
00:12:53,661 --> 00:12:56,302
Mistress Padme.
Thank the Maker you're safe.

205
00:12:56,662 --> 00:12:57,622
Have you...

206
00:13:00,702 --> 00:13:04,742
- Where's Jar Jar?
- I'm afraid he went to rescue you.

207
00:13:06,062 --> 00:13:08,262
- What about the Jedi?
- There is no Jedi.

208
00:13:08,382 --> 00:13:11,582
It appears the battle droids
have mistaken Jar Jar for one.

209
00:13:11,982 --> 00:13:12,942
That's not good.

210
00:13:14,382 --> 00:13:15,702
Hang on, My Lady.

211
00:13:16,102 --> 00:13:18,262
This is our chance
to capture Viceroy Gunray,

212
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:19,902
but I need you to stay calm.

213
00:13:20,022 --> 00:13:21,903
Go back to the ship
and call for help.

214
00:13:22,182 --> 00:13:25,102
I regret the transmitters
on the ship are out of order.

215
00:13:25,463 --> 00:13:26,302
What?

216
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:27,902
The ship has been destroyed.

217
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:29,703
- Battle droids?
- No.

218
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:31,174
- Jar Jar?
- Jar Jar.

219
00:13:31,302 --> 00:13:33,502
All right,
then find a communications room

220
00:13:33,622 --> 00:13:35,102
and send out a distress signal.

221
00:13:35,222 --> 00:13:37,222
Hopefully there are
some clone ships within range.

222
00:13:37,342 --> 00:13:38,582
I'll track down Jar Jar.

223
00:13:47,342 --> 00:13:48,302
Viceroy Gunray,

224
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:51,262
when can we
expect the supplies to arrive?

225
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:53,023
My people are starving.

226
00:13:53,423 --> 00:13:54,862
They haven't arrived yet?

227
00:13:55,183 --> 00:13:58,463
I'm sorry. Your request will
be taken into consideration

228
00:13:58,702 --> 00:14:01,022
after Senator Amidala's execution.

229
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:02,623
Execution?

230
00:14:02,863 --> 00:14:03,823
You can't.

231
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,382
She's a prisoner of war.
We were promised.

232
00:14:06,622 --> 00:14:08,383
You are under my protection now,

233
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:10,782
and you will do
what I demand of you.

234
00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:18,702
Padme was right.

235
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:22,063
I have made a grave mistake
joining with the Separatists.

236
00:14:24,223 --> 00:14:25,422
I know, I know.

237
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:27,742
We must appease Viceroy Gunray

238
00:14:27,902 --> 00:14:29,822
so he does not destroy us all.

239
00:14:30,463 --> 00:14:32,223
Be on alert for that Jedi.

240
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,303
He is our only hope.

241
00:14:41,503 --> 00:14:43,823
Bring Senator Amidala before me.

242
00:14:44,943 --> 00:14:47,503
She caused a great deal
of damage to our droids,

243
00:14:47,663 --> 00:14:49,103
and she escaped, sir.

244
00:14:49,463 --> 00:14:51,223
- Escaped?
- It's the Jedi!

245
00:14:51,943 --> 00:14:53,503
- Sir.
- Shoot him!

246
00:15:06,544 --> 00:15:08,863
Thisa rescuing is hard jobbing.

247
00:15:14,063 --> 00:15:14,983
Jar Jar!

248
00:15:19,343 --> 00:15:20,183
Capture her!

249
00:15:39,783 --> 00:15:40,623
Oh, dear.

250
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,104
The Jedi has been spotted
in the south hall.

251
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,503
- Let's move.
- Roger, roger.

252
00:15:48,023 --> 00:15:50,024
I think that was rather clever.

253
00:15:52,984 --> 00:15:54,144
Sir, over there!

254
00:15:54,504 --> 00:15:55,744
The Jedi is escaping.

255
00:15:56,064 --> 00:15:56,984
Not likely.

256
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:17,104
Freeze.
Surrender.

257
00:16:17,264 --> 00:16:18,384
Where did she go?

258
00:16:19,304 --> 00:16:20,104
What the...?

259
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:35,224
Jar Jar...
No.

260
00:16:36,104 --> 00:16:37,776
Senator Amidala.

261
00:16:39,024 --> 00:16:41,745
So good to see you at last.

262
00:16:44,345 --> 00:16:46,384
Hello?
I say, is anyone there?

263
00:16:47,785 --> 00:16:49,984
Why is there never an R2 unit
when you need one?

264
00:16:50,304 --> 00:16:52,425
<i>This is a restricted frequency.
Who is this?</i>

265
00:16:52,824 --> 00:16:54,784
I am C-3PO, human-cyborg...

266
00:16:54,944 --> 00:16:57,144
<i>No droids.
This code is for military use only.</i>

267
00:16:57,304 --> 00:16:58,745
This is a priority message

268
00:16:58,944 --> 00:17:00,984
from Senator Amidala on Rodia.

269
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:03,344
- We require immediate assist...
- Hold it.

270
00:17:03,504 --> 00:17:05,624
- Oh, dear.
- You're under arrest.

271
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,384
So you didn't find the Jedi, then?

272
00:17:08,824 --> 00:17:10,265
You got him, boss.

273
00:17:10,505 --> 00:17:12,985
Too bad you can't take out
that slug monster.

274
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:21,184
Yousa okay, bogey?

275
00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:23,904
Yousa save-ed me.
Yousa my new palo.

276
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:29,865
Mistress Padme!

277
00:17:30,145 --> 00:17:31,625
Where you able to find Jar Jar?

278
00:17:31,905 --> 00:17:33,705
I think Jar Jar's dead, 3PO.

279
00:17:34,065 --> 00:17:35,105
Not again.

280
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:36,665
Oh, poor Jar Jar.

281
00:17:36,825 --> 00:17:38,745
He was always such a misfit.

282
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,065
I want to make sure this time.

283
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:47,025
Don't do this, Viceroy.

284
00:17:47,184 --> 00:17:50,744
I beg you, do not kill her.
There must be another way.

285
00:17:51,185 --> 00:17:52,145
Silence!

286
00:17:52,544 --> 00:17:55,985
I say, I think there has been
some horrible mistake.

287
00:17:56,145 --> 00:17:58,265
I am a protocol droid
on a diplomatic...

288
00:17:58,665 --> 00:17:59,625
Ready.

289
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:02,105
Aim.

290
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:08,425
It's the Jedi!

291
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:12,425
- It's the Je... Juh...
- Jedi.

292
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:14,105
Release the senator.

293
00:18:14,905 --> 00:18:16,505
That Jedi is going to attack.

294
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:19,281
Shoot him!
Shoot them all!

295
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:28,825
That Jedi has summoned a monster.

296
00:18:42,225 --> 00:18:43,985
We have to get out of here.

297
00:18:58,066 --> 00:18:59,665
I made a very good friend.

298
00:19:00,146 --> 00:19:02,186
Hold it right there, Viceroy.

299
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,266
At last we can finish this.

300
00:19:06,586 --> 00:19:08,586
Onaconda, it is about time.

301
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,506
Blast that Jedi and shoot her!

302
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:20,266
Uncle Ono, I think it's time

303
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:22,746
to tell the Viceroy
about our little secret...

304
00:19:23,106 --> 00:19:25,145
how you never meant
to leave the Republic

305
00:19:25,386 --> 00:19:27,666
and how you truly care
what's best for your people.

306
00:19:28,145 --> 00:19:29,706
What is she talking about?

307
00:19:30,106 --> 00:19:32,265
Sorry, Viceroy, she is right.

308
00:19:32,746 --> 00:19:34,346
I am with the Republic,

309
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,586
and you are under arrest.

310
00:19:36,866 --> 00:19:40,186
You will pay for this treachery.

311
00:19:40,706 --> 00:19:43,586
Viceroy, you are going to
spend the rest of the war in a cell.

312
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,386
Your victory will be fleeting,
Senators.

313
00:19:51,026 --> 00:19:52,746
Those are Republic warships.

314
00:19:52,906 --> 00:19:54,546
The clones have arrived.

315
00:19:58,066 --> 00:20:00,706
We got your message, General.
What are your orders?

316
00:20:01,106 --> 00:20:02,866
My message got through.

317
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:05,306
Take this Separatist scum away.

318
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:07,026
Master Bombad,

319
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:10,106
on behalf of the people of Rodia,
I thank you.

320
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:12,186
You're either the bravest

321
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:14,986
or the most foolish Jedi
I have ever met.

322
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:17,746
I'm just a Gungan,
and I don't think I'm either.

323
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:20,666
Well, I think
you're a little bit of both.

324
00:20:23,746 --> 00:20:27,306
<i>Senator Amidala has brought
your people's needs to my attention,</i>

325
00:20:27,546 --> 00:20:30,907
<i>and I have already sent a convoy
of supply ships to your system.</i>

326
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:32,506
Thank you, Chancellor.

327
00:20:32,786 --> 00:20:35,826
<i>The capture of Viceroy Gunray
is a major victory for the Republic.</i>

328
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:38,467
<i>All of you should be commended
for your courage,</i>

329
00:20:38,786 --> 00:20:42,266
<i>and from what I hear,
especially you, Representative Binks.</i>

330
00:20:42,427 --> 00:20:43,787
Ah, it'sa nothing.

331
00:20:46,707 --> 00:20:48,587
Can you ever forgive me, Padme?

332
00:20:48,907 --> 00:20:51,946
It is the Republic that should be asking
your forgiveness, my old friend.

333
00:20:52,427 --> 00:20:55,467
Far too often, we forget
that our most important allies

334
00:20:55,627 --> 00:20:57,787
are not always the most powerful.
