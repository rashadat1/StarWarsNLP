1
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:17,989
<i>Manhunt!</i>

2
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:20,190
<i>After a long and perilous search,</i>

3
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:23,829
<i>the Jedi finally track down
Separatist leader Count Dooku.</i>

4
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,830
<i>During a heroic attempt
to capture the count,</i>

5
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,310
<i>Anakin Skywalker has gone missing.</i>

6
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,590
<i>Having lost contact with Skywalker,</i>

7
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,270
<i>Obi-Wan Kenobi heads toward
his friend's last known location,</i>

8
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,350
<i>a lone Separatist frigate</i>

9
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,710
<i>in the far reaches of the Outer Rim.</i>

10
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:15,191
Don't bother to get up.

11
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:17,712
You're not the prisoner
I'm looking for.

12
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:29,872
Oh, it's you.

13
00:01:30,432 --> 00:01:32,352
This is how you thank me
for rescuing you,

14
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:33,872
pounce on me from the ceiling?

15
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:37,552
Kind of difficult without a...
lightsaber. Thanks.

16
00:01:37,952 --> 00:01:40,592
Did you manage to locate Dooku
before landing in jail?

17
00:01:40,712 --> 00:01:42,032
Well, I know he's on board.

18
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:44,512
Might have been able to do
something about it if I'd had my weapon.

19
00:01:44,952 --> 00:01:47,112
It was important for you
to arrive without it

20
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:50,432
- so your capture would be convincing.
- Oh, they were convinced, all right.

21
00:01:50,672 --> 00:01:53,233
But how come
I'm the one getting caught all the time?

22
00:01:53,352 --> 00:01:54,632
It doesn't look good.

23
00:01:54,753 --> 00:01:57,952
When you're a Jedi master,
you can make the plan.

24
00:01:58,072 --> 00:02:01,272
That's just it. How can I become a Jedi
master if I'm always getting caught?

25
00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:03,793
At least you're a master
at getting caught.

26
00:02:04,313 --> 00:02:05,433
Very funny.

27
00:02:08,232 --> 00:02:09,513
Surprise, surprise.

28
00:02:11,713 --> 00:02:13,073
If it isn't Count Dooku.

29
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,753
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

30
00:02:15,113 --> 00:02:16,513
I thought I sensed

31
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:19,433
an unpleasant disturbance
in the force.

32
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:22,273
I see you've freed young Skywalker.

33
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:23,913
Where might he be

34
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:27,033
if you weren't always around
to rescue him?

35
00:02:27,954 --> 00:02:30,313
Sir,
there's a Jedi cruiser attacking.

36
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:36,554
Let's try not to blow up the ship
before they get off this time.

37
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:38,754
Your ship is surrounded, Count.

38
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,914
Republic troops are boarding
as we speak.

39
00:02:41,234 --> 00:02:43,034
Jedi fools.

40
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:45,554
I should have seen that coming.

41
00:02:45,714 --> 00:02:47,394
- What are you doing?
- Following him.

42
00:02:47,514 --> 00:02:49,714
Not that way.
We need to cut him off.

43
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:52,234
You cut him off. I'll follow him
and meet you at the hangar.

44
00:02:52,354 --> 00:02:53,514
Why do I even try?

45
00:03:07,114 --> 00:03:08,154
Oh, great.

46
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:12,635
- Your ship is ready, sir.
- Good.

47
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:39,235
- I thought you were following Dooku.
- I was. I followed him here.

48
00:03:40,675 --> 00:03:41,515
Hang on.

49
00:03:52,236 --> 00:03:54,196
Ahsoka,
Dooku managed to escape.

50
00:03:54,436 --> 00:03:56,356
We're in pursuit,
but we could use reinforcements.

51
00:03:56,676 --> 00:03:58,436
<i>Follow us in what ships
you can round up.</i>

52
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,396
We'll get there
as soon as we can.

53
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:14,276
That was easy.

54
00:04:16,116 --> 00:04:17,637
Lucky for you,
I'm an excellent shot.

55
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:19,676
Well, now those fighters
are attacking.

56
00:04:20,076 --> 00:04:21,036
I'm on it.

57
00:04:21,836 --> 00:04:23,356
He's getting too close.

58
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,677
Lucky for you,
I'm an excellent pilot.

59
00:04:40,517 --> 00:04:43,917
For all your expertise,
this is not a very smooth landing.

60
00:04:46,997 --> 00:04:50,438
If you'd hit that second fighter,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

61
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,238
I've had better landings.

62
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:03,558
Dooku.

63
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:13,758
What's this, a homing beacon?

64
00:05:14,678 --> 00:05:17,438
Which means the distinguished count
is waiting for help.

65
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,558
- So he can't be far off.
- His engine is damaged.

66
00:05:20,678 --> 00:05:23,998
- He's not going anywhere.
- Not without a homing beacon.

67
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:31,358
There.
Caves are a good start.

68
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,799
Strange.

69
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:40,759
You sense it too.
Many life forms in there.

70
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,878
And Dooku's one of them.

71
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:46,319
Let's try to get him
before something else does.

72
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:03,720
What's that?

73
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,399
Run!

74
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,881
You won't be needing this anymore,
Skywalker.

75
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:17,922
Well, well.

76
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:19,842
What do we have here?

77
00:07:21,402 --> 00:07:22,402
Who are you?

78
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:24,762
More importantly, my friend,

79
00:07:24,882 --> 00:07:26,602
who are you?

80
00:07:35,483 --> 00:07:37,722
Master!
Obi-Wan, can you hear me?

81
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:39,202
Master!

82
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:52,922
Anakin, when I tell you to run, run.

83
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,963
Master! You're alive.

84
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,843
And where's your lightsaber?

85
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,483
It got knocked out of my hand.

86
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,483
- By a rock?
- Yeah, by a rock.

87
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:04,203
- It's got to be here somewhere.
- That is a feeble excuse.

88
00:08:04,323 --> 00:08:06,523
You know what would be helpful?
A little light.

89
00:08:06,643 --> 00:08:07,683
Certainly.

90
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:14,323
Silly thing.
It was just working a minute ago.

91
00:08:14,923 --> 00:08:18,004
You don't suppose
it was hit by a rock, do you?

92
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:23,844
This should be interesting.

93
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:37,364
Your solar sailor is very beautiful.

94
00:08:37,804 --> 00:08:39,405
It's a pretty rare ship,

95
00:08:39,884 --> 00:08:41,404
very expensive.

96
00:08:42,044 --> 00:08:45,804
What are you doing
all the way out here?

97
00:08:45,924 --> 00:08:48,845
I sustained some damage
in an asteroid storm

98
00:08:49,204 --> 00:08:52,565
and had to make a landing.
Feel free to help yourself to it.

99
00:08:56,164 --> 00:08:59,205
If you need transport,
the nearest planet is Florrum.

100
00:08:59,525 --> 00:09:00,845
It's six parsecs away.

101
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:02,805
Is it civilized?

102
00:09:03,605 --> 00:09:06,245
That depends
on your definition of civilized.

103
00:09:06,685 --> 00:09:09,965
But you would certainly be
more comfortable there than here.

104
00:09:10,085 --> 00:09:13,645
Vanqor is no place to be after dark.

105
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:16,205
Perhaps I shall take you up
on your offer.

106
00:09:16,485 --> 00:09:17,445
Very good.

107
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:21,366
Now all that's left to do
is settle my fee.

108
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:22,965
Fee?

109
00:09:23,085 --> 00:09:26,525
Just a little something
to cover my expenses.

110
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:28,886
It shouldn't be a problem
for someone

111
00:09:29,006 --> 00:09:31,445
so obviously wealthy as yourself.

112
00:09:33,646 --> 00:09:36,926
I'd be happy to compensate you
for your services.

113
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:40,006
That's it, boys!
We are heading home.

114
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:44,846
Jump in anytime!

115
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:46,566
Oh, you're doing fine.

116
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,166
She seems to like you.

117
00:09:48,486 --> 00:09:50,086
Yeah, lucky me!

118
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,366
This isn't as much fun as it looks.

119
00:09:54,606 --> 00:09:57,047
I thought gundarks
were only found on Vanqor.

120
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:59,166
Then this system must be Vanqor.

121
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:04,927
- So that would make this one...
- The mother of all gundarks.

122
00:10:05,046 --> 00:10:06,006
Precisely.

123
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:09,006
Are you gonna help me?

124
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,607
Well, you took your time.

125
00:10:33,088 --> 00:10:36,447
It's a pity. I was just starting
to sense a connection.

126
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:38,008
Should I leave you two alone,

127
00:10:38,128 --> 00:10:41,968
or would you prefer to find a way out
of this hole before she wakes up?

128
00:11:04,608 --> 00:11:06,648
Welcome to Florrum.

129
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,408
Lose your flashy sword?

130
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:15,128
Are these
what you were looking for, Jedi?

131
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:18,889
I am more powerful than any Jedi.

132
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:21,889
Know that you are dealing
with a Sith lord.

133
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:25,569
You're still outnumbered.

134
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:28,489
The leader of the clanker army...

135
00:11:28,609 --> 00:11:30,849
and a Sith lord, no less.

136
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:34,129
Someone is sure
to pay a pretty price for you.

137
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:38,049
Provide me
with the proper means of communications.

138
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:41,169
I will arrange for any ransom
to be paid.

139
00:11:41,729 --> 00:11:44,930
And you will arrange for your armies
to crush us as well.

140
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:48,770
You don't survive in the Outer Rim
by being stupid.

141
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,570
If the Separatists will pay
to get you back,

142
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,730
chances are,
the Republic will offer

143
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:56,050
even more.

144
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,890
- Sounds like another gundark.
- It's too far away to worry about.

145
00:12:05,011 --> 00:12:06,810
It won't stay far away.

146
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,451
New problem.

147
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,250
That's not good.

148
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:19,651
It's just gas.

149
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:21,411
Probably toxic gas.

150
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:23,091
That's good.

151
00:12:23,211 --> 00:12:25,251
Maybe it'll kill your gundark.

152
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,251
- And maybe it will kill us.
- Come on.

153
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:30,531
Let's get out of here.

154
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:34,731
This isn't gonna work.

155
00:12:34,851 --> 00:12:36,771
- I can't breathe.
- As always,

156
00:12:36,891 --> 00:12:38,451
I'm open to sugges...

157
00:12:40,412 --> 00:12:43,051
Come on, Obi-Wan.
Don't give up now.

158
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:52,972
- What was that?
- I have no idea.

159
00:12:54,092 --> 00:12:55,131
Master!

160
00:12:57,932 --> 00:12:59,572
Looks like I got here just in time.

161
00:13:00,372 --> 00:13:02,052
What do you mean, "just in time"?

162
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:04,732
- You were in very big trouble.
- Trouble?

163
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:07,412
We were simply searching
for Count Dooku.

164
00:13:08,452 --> 00:13:11,212
We had the situation well under control,
my little Padawan.

165
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:12,892
I see.

166
00:13:13,012 --> 00:13:16,132
So which part of the situation
did you have under control:

167
00:13:16,252 --> 00:13:20,053
the blocked entrance, the poison gas,
or that gundark behind you?

168
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:21,492
Gundark?

169
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:24,612
You mean the one
that's too far away to worry about?

170
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:27,652
Block the entrance.

171
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:37,212
There's still Dooku to deal with.

172
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,813
You let him get away?

173
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:42,693
No, not get away exactly. Just...

174
00:13:43,853 --> 00:13:45,453
Chime in anytime.

175
00:13:47,253 --> 00:13:49,814
Oh, no.
I'm enjoying this far too much.

176
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:53,654
<i>If you want the Sith lord,</i>

177
00:13:53,774 --> 00:13:56,293
<i>it will cost you a million credits.</i>

178
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:58,333
<i>The payment will be in spice</i>

179
00:13:58,694 --> 00:14:01,493
<i>delivered in an unarmed
diplomatic ship.</i>

180
00:14:01,773 --> 00:14:03,573
We will need proof he's alive

181
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:06,013
before agreeing to your terms.

182
00:14:06,573 --> 00:14:10,133
<i>Let me present
your fearless Sith lord.</i>

183
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:14,174
<i>I'm afraid he's too embarrassed
to speak.</i>

184
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:17,454
A hologram can be faked.

185
00:14:18,534 --> 00:14:19,855
<i>You want proof?</i>

186
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,014
<i>This is his lightsaber.</i>

187
00:14:24,974 --> 00:14:27,375
Belongs to Dooku,
that lightsaber does.

188
00:14:28,174 --> 00:14:29,295
This scum...

189
00:14:29,414 --> 00:14:32,614
having possession of Dooku's lightsaber
proves nothing.

190
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:35,055
<i>If you refuse,</i>

191
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:37,655
<i>I am sure
the Separatist council</i>

192
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:40,295
<i>will be more than willing
to meet my price.</i>

193
00:14:41,294 --> 00:14:44,495
We may never have a better chance
to capture Count Dooku.

194
00:14:45,455 --> 00:14:46,655
We would like...

195
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,815
to send two Jedi
to confirm you have Count Dooku

196
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:51,335
before delivering the ransom.

197
00:14:53,215 --> 00:14:55,135
<i>Send your Jedi,
but they must be unarmed.</i>

198
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:58,095
<i>- Impossible.
- They will be safe.</i>

199
00:14:58,656 --> 00:15:02,175
<i>We have no interest
in getting involved in your war.</i>

200
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:09,015
We've reestablished contact
with Kenobi and Skywalker.

201
00:15:09,135 --> 00:15:10,696
They're in a system
close to Florrum.

202
00:15:11,096 --> 00:15:14,055
And most eager to find Dooku,
they are.

203
00:15:17,976 --> 00:15:20,416
<i>His only stipulation is
that you arrive unarmed.</i>

204
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:21,536
Unarmed?

205
00:15:21,896 --> 00:15:24,016
We know very little
about these pirates.

206
00:15:24,136 --> 00:15:27,576
We may be walking blind into what
could very well be a hostile situation.

207
00:15:27,736 --> 00:15:30,056
<i>We can't let Dooku
slip through our fingers again.</i>

208
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:31,776
<i>Report back as soon as you arrive.</i>

209
00:15:33,656 --> 00:15:35,056
This should be fun.

210
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:07,177
Follow me.

211
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:32,258
Gentlemen.

212
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:35,138
Can I offer you something to drink?

213
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:37,738
No, thank you.

214
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,898
Congratulations on your capture
of Count Dooku.

215
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:46,578
- Very impressive.
- Yes, it was.

216
00:16:47,498 --> 00:16:50,419
Even a Sith lord is no match
for my warriors.

217
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:55,458
He put up quite a fight.

218
00:16:55,578 --> 00:16:58,458
Blasters, cannons,
that glowy thing...

219
00:16:59,258 --> 00:17:01,139
- You mean a lightsaber?
- That's it.

220
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,139
And I don't need to tell you,

221
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:05,459
those things can do some damage.

222
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,939
Carved up some of my best men
pretty good

223
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:09,579
before I could
get the jump on him.

224
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:13,139
And how exactly
did you get the jump on him?

225
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:14,259
With this?

226
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,419
We have no interest
in disagreeing with you.

227
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,060
All we want is to confirm
you are holding Dooku,

228
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,140
and we'll go.

229
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,379
I will arrange a meeting.

230
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,940
Look how the mighty Sith lord
has fallen.

231
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,701
This place suits you, Count.

232
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,300
It wasn't so long ago
that you yourself

233
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,700
were in similar surroundings

234
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,381
on my ship.

235
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,460
Yeah, but now I'm free,
and you're not.

236
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,900
I'm confident the situation
will rectify itself soon.

237
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,460
Soon you'll be brought
to trial by the Senate

238
00:18:06,581 --> 00:18:09,220
and most likely spend
a very long time in a cell

239
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,821
just like this one.

240
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,061
And that's if you're lucky.

241
00:18:13,941 --> 00:18:15,821
My naive young Jedi,

242
00:18:15,981 --> 00:18:18,181
you must be overly optimistic

243
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:20,061
if you think these Weequayans

244
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:22,941
plan to let you leave this planet.

245
00:18:23,621 --> 00:18:26,781
They're planet-hopping thieves
looking for a quick score.

246
00:18:26,901 --> 00:18:29,181
They have no interest
in picking a fight with Jedi.

247
00:18:29,581 --> 00:18:31,901
They are devious and deceitful...

248
00:18:32,301 --> 00:18:34,822
and most importantly, stupid.

249
00:18:35,102 --> 00:18:37,341
It's a wonder you don't get along
with them, Dooku.

250
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:39,902
You have so much in common.

251
00:18:40,422 --> 00:18:43,982
You underestimate them
at your own peril, Kenobi.

252
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,582
I don't know about you,
but I could use some rest.

253
00:18:52,022 --> 00:18:54,262
Remember, Anakin,
this could still be a trap.

254
00:18:54,422 --> 00:18:56,103
You're not worried about Dooku,
are you?

255
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:59,062
No, I'm worried about these pirates.

256
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:04,863
Jedi!

257
00:19:05,222 --> 00:19:06,903
Now that your business
is completed,

258
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:10,302
we invite you to join us
in the grand hall for a banquet.

259
00:19:10,982 --> 00:19:12,903
And a true Weequay banquet

260
00:19:13,022 --> 00:19:15,383
is not to be missed.

261
00:19:18,222 --> 00:19:20,663
No question, they have Dooku.
Send the ransom.

262
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,543
<i>He's being securely held?</i>

263
00:19:23,343 --> 00:19:25,663
<i>- And very cranky about it.
- Good.</i>

264
00:19:25,943 --> 00:19:27,903
<i>Senator Kharrus
and Representative Binks</i>

265
00:19:28,023 --> 00:19:29,943
<i>will be dispatched immediately.</i>

266
00:19:45,024 --> 00:19:45,823
Now,

267
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:48,783
can I persuade you
to join us for a drink?

268
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:50,983
It's a tradition,

269
00:19:51,104 --> 00:19:52,864
in the name of friendship.

270
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,264
All right, but nothing too strong.

271
00:19:55,383 --> 00:19:58,744
- He's flying.
- Bring our guests some refreshments.

272
00:20:15,304 --> 00:20:17,305
To a successful transaction.

273
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:25,785
To powerful pirates
and new friends of the Republic.

274
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:29,825
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen.

275
00:20:32,185 --> 00:20:34,385
- I still don't get it.
- Get what?

276
00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:36,385
How a bunch of drunken pirates

277
00:20:36,505 --> 00:20:38,305
managed to catch Dooku
when we couldn't.

278
00:20:38,665 --> 00:20:40,385
Maybe there's a lesson
to be learned here.

279
00:20:41,265 --> 00:20:43,585
- I still don't get it.
- It's to remind us

280
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:45,665
to be humble and never too proud

281
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:47,665
to accept a gift
when it comes our way.

282
00:20:48,065 --> 00:20:50,586
Well, to unexpected gifts, then.

283
00:20:50,785 --> 00:20:51,866
Hear, hear.
