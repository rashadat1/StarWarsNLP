1
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:17,839
<i>Invasion!</i>

2
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:21,878
<i>Separatist leader Wat Tambor
has taken control of the planet Ryloth</i>

3
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,638
<i>and subjugates its people
through a brutal droid occupation.</i>

4
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:29,238
<i>In a daring surprise attack,
Jedi Anakin Skywalker</i>

5
00:00:29,398 --> 00:00:30,797
<i>and his padawan, Ahsoka Tano,</i>

6
00:00:31,158 --> 00:00:33,758
<i>defeated the space blockade
guarding the planet.</i>

7
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:37,165
<i>Now, Jedi Generals Mace Windu
and Obi-Wan Kenobi</i>

8
00:00:37,557 --> 00:00:40,637
<i>lead a massive invasion
to liberate the starving people.</i>

9
00:00:40,757 --> 00:00:43,436
First trick will be getting our troops
on the ground.

10
00:00:43,596 --> 00:00:46,996
If you take the city of Nabat first,
we'll have our landing zone.

11
00:00:47,516 --> 00:00:49,716
Well, it's time to meet the natives.

12
00:01:06,674 --> 00:01:09,593
<i>You must not allow the clones
to reach the surface.</i>

13
00:01:09,994 --> 00:01:12,633
Our new proton cannon
are in the optimum position

14
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:14,074
to prevent that, sir.

15
00:01:14,593 --> 00:01:15,553
<i>What?</i>

16
00:01:16,513 --> 00:01:18,873
<i>What if they focus the attack
on your cannon?</i>

17
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:23,393
I am utilizing the prisoners
from this village as living shields.

18
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:27,792
I calculate the Jedi will not risk
the prisoners' safety

19
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:29,351
with a direct assault.

20
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:38,031
We need to remember
why we're here.

21
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:41,231
We came to aid the Twi'leks,
not destroy their home.

22
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:42,710
Cody?

23
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,110
That means we'll be taking it back
the hard way.

24
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:48,110
Minimal destruction with blasters
and droid poppers only.

25
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,270
No rockets or detonators.
Check your aim.

26
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,310
Keep an eye out for the locals.
Am I understood?

27
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,469
Sir, yes, sir!

28
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,309
If we're here
to free the tail-heads,

29
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:59,429
the least they can do
is get out of our way.

30
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:02,028
Sir, the enemy is in range.

31
00:02:02,668 --> 00:02:03,908
Fire at will.

32
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,517
General, the enemy fire
is penetrating our shields.

33
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,310
Get me Kenobi.

34
00:02:31,837 --> 00:02:33,603
<i>We can't risk landing
the larger transports</i>

35
00:02:33,637 --> 00:02:37,197
<i>- until you take out those guns.
- Pull back. We'll take care of it.</i>

36
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:43,718
Who's up for a challenge?

37
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:47,267
We're not getting any reinforcements
until those guns are out of commission.

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,378
Here we go again.

39
00:02:53,968 --> 00:02:56,687
Commander, the Republic transports
have turned away,

40
00:02:56,807 --> 00:02:58,967
but the gunships
are still heading toward us.

41
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:00,927
Just as I calculated.

42
00:03:39,434 --> 00:03:41,831
Prepare for their ground assault.

43
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:46,197
I think I see movement in the trees.

44
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:47,758
- Fire!
- Fire!

45
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:58,403
Come on, men, let's go!
Go, go, go!

46
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,918
That bunker is gonna be
a problem, General.

47
00:04:11,038 --> 00:04:13,925
Leave the bunker to me.
Bring in your troopers on my signal!

48
00:04:14,214 --> 00:04:16,419
You two wanted action?
Follow me.

49
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:17,955
You heard him, Waxer.

50
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:29,952
Let's take them out.
Now!

51
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:33,789
We'll try to get
closer to the wall.

52
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:35,803
Try again.
I'll give you some help.

53
00:04:48,975 --> 00:04:50,696
Ghost company, let's move!

54
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:55,094
Sir, I've lost contact
with our outer defenses.

55
00:04:55,615 --> 00:04:58,735
The Republic troops
have overrun the village perimeter.

56
00:04:58,854 --> 00:05:01,494
Find out
how the Jedi plan to attack.

57
00:05:02,014 --> 00:05:03,134
Roger, roger.

58
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:07,934
The wall is secure, sir.
Are we moving on to the guns?

59
00:05:08,334 --> 00:05:10,974
We need to know
what the droids have in store for us.

60
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:12,733
Send your best men to scout ahead.

61
00:05:13,253 --> 00:05:14,373
Will do, sir.

62
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:16,613
Boil, Waxer,
come with me.

63
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:18,653
I guess we're the best.

64
00:05:31,251 --> 00:05:33,091
Buildings are just buildings.

65
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:35,891
What really makes a city
are the inhabitants that live in it.

66
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:38,050
So where are they?

67
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,090
We'll check out the courtyard.
You two take the south sector.

68
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,210
Be back at command by 0620.

69
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,450
Yes, sir.

70
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,610
I tell you, Boil, this is creepy.

71
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:54,009
You think they've killed
all of them?

72
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:55,969
Well, there are no bodies.

73
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:59,848
They were driven from their homes.
I don't think they had a...

74
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:01,609
Had a what?

75
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:04,848
Choice.

76
00:06:18,486 --> 00:06:20,807
Not going to be easy
getting to those guns, sir.

77
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:22,766
There is always a way, Wooley.

78
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:31,285
Wait.
Twi'leks.

79
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:34,645
They're holding
all the survivors hostage.

80
00:06:35,244 --> 00:06:37,724
We have to report this
to General Kenobi.

81
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:52,283
We found the guns.

82
00:06:52,403 --> 00:06:55,802
They're in the courtyard here and here.
But there's a complication.

83
00:06:55,922 --> 00:06:58,882
They've taken the locals hostage
and they're using them as shields.

84
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,362
The Twi'lek prisoners will make this
difficult but not impossible.

85
00:07:02,482 --> 00:07:05,521
I still have a good plan
for taking out those guns.

86
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:08,802
<i>Getting the villagers out of harm's way
is our first priority.</i>

87
00:07:08,922 --> 00:07:10,561
<i>I have faith in you, General Kenobi.</i>

88
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:12,961
Cody, we'll go in
with everything we have.

89
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,281
Clear those hostages.

90
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,520
So it's General Kenobi
who is leading this assault.

91
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,560
He is known
for his deceptive maneuvers.

92
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,840
Roger, roger.
Download his file.

93
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,998
- It's just a little girl.
- What are we going to do with her?

94
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,558
Why do we have to do anything?

95
00:07:43,718 --> 00:07:46,677
- We've got a mission to finish.
- We should do something.

96
00:07:46,837 --> 00:07:49,118
- I say we take her with us.
- You can't be serious.

97
00:07:49,237 --> 00:07:50,797
She'll only slow us down.

98
00:07:51,557 --> 00:07:54,397
- Look, she's afraid of us.
- Not us. Quick, hide!

99
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:00,499
That was a recon unit.
We'd better get moving.

100
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:02,019
We can't leave her here.

101
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:03,978
Fine, we'll take her.

102
00:08:05,378 --> 00:08:06,498
Be careful.

103
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:09,098
Don't worry, Waxer.
I don't think she's armed.

104
00:08:11,018 --> 00:08:12,658
Little tail-head bit me.

105
00:08:13,218 --> 00:08:14,618
Stop, you're scaring her.

106
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,497
She probably thinks we're droids.

107
00:08:21,777 --> 00:08:24,576
It's all right.
See, I'm flesh and blood,

108
00:08:25,136 --> 00:08:26,216
just like you.

109
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:27,936
She looks half starved.

110
00:08:28,736 --> 00:08:29,696
Here.

111
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,094
No, I'm Waxer.

112
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:50,934
He's Boil.

113
00:08:53,454 --> 00:08:55,893
You made a friend.
Mission accomplished.

114
00:08:56,293 --> 00:08:57,294
Can we go now?

115
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:00,653
Come on, kid.

116
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,292
Come on.

117
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:04,932
Look, she doesn't even want to go.

118
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:08,412
Little monster was fine
before we came along, so let's move.

119
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:35,929
Sergeant, are the creatures ready?

120
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:38,049
I starved them,
like you ordered, sir.

121
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,461
Are you sure
they will not attack us?

122
00:09:42,653 --> 00:09:46,201
I need a test
to verify my theory.

123
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:48,504
Sir, what are you doing?

124
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:50,710
Oh, no.

125
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,218
Not my rotovator.

126
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,713
As I calculated,

127
00:09:58,001 --> 00:10:00,974
the creatures require
organic feed.

128
00:10:01,742 --> 00:10:03,181
Well, that's a relief.

129
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,867
It will not be for the clones.

130
00:10:06,443 --> 00:10:09,703
They will provide
a most generous supply.

131
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:21,391
I wonder what happened
to her family.

132
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:24,191
They're probably dead.
Hopefully, she'll survive this mess.

133
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,470
So what happens to her?
I mean, after we leave.

134
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,830
I don't know.

135
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,110
Don't get any ideas.
We're not taking her with us.

136
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:40,549
She's gone.

137
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:43,828
I'm sure
the little biter will turn up.

138
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:48,628
There you are.

139
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,548
How'd she get in front of us?

140
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,867
No, don't go that way!
That's where the recon droid went.

141
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:01,307
Waxer, let her go.

142
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,107
I'm not just going to
let the droids get her.

143
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:06,466
I'm just trying to keep you alive!

144
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,186
Darn if I know why.

145
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:17,785
Where's she going?

146
00:11:25,664 --> 00:11:27,145
Wait!
Hold on there!

147
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,343
There you are.

148
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:35,504
Good, you caught her.

149
00:11:35,624 --> 00:11:37,703
You know,
I have binders if we need 'em.

150
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:38,703
What?

151
00:11:44,543 --> 00:11:46,542
What are we doing here, anyway?

152
00:12:13,826 --> 00:12:15,586
I guess this was her home.

153
00:12:16,265 --> 00:12:18,545
Poor little thing.
She lost it all.

154
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,742
It's okay now.
We're here to help.

155
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:58,261
Don't cry, kid.
We'll keep you safe.

156
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:00,220
I promise.

157
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,740
The men set, Cody?
What is it?

158
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,780
Waxer and Boil are not responding.

159
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:15,099
- They never returned from scouting.
- That isn't like them.

160
00:13:15,219 --> 00:13:16,939
They may have run into trouble.

161
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:18,939
Sergeant,
use the high-powered transmitter

162
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:21,659
- to see if you can reach Waxer and Boil.
- Yes, sir!

163
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:25,338
Let's get the rest of the men moving.
The others will catch up.

164
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,418
They are on the move.

165
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:29,778
Sergeant, the attack is coming.

166
00:13:30,498 --> 00:13:31,897
Release the beasts.

167
00:13:32,577 --> 00:13:34,497
It is time to execute my plan.

168
00:13:34,738 --> 00:13:35,857
Roger, roger.

169
00:13:45,136 --> 00:13:47,576
It's the commander.
We're way overdue, Waxer.

170
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:50,176
We're going to end up
polishing R2 units.

171
00:13:50,815 --> 00:13:53,656
Wait. How are we going to
explain all this? Her?

172
00:13:54,695 --> 00:13:55,775
You're asking me?

173
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,655
Maybe if we hurry back, we can
tell them we ran into a little trouble.

174
00:13:58,774 --> 00:13:59,975
Oh, that's for sure.

175
00:14:00,095 --> 00:14:02,214
And our transmissions
were jammed by the droids.

176
00:14:02,838 --> 00:14:05,239
It's worth a try.
But mark my words,

177
00:14:05,718 --> 00:14:07,478
this will end badly.

178
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:24,676
I think I know
why the kid never came back here.

179
00:14:26,676 --> 00:14:29,316
You see what happens
when we don't follow orders?

180
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:30,996
Let's get out of here!

181
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:38,115
These suckers won't give up!

182
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:40,674
You grab the gun
and I'll hold 'em back.

183
00:15:21,006 --> 00:15:21,773
They're not stopping.

184
00:15:21,774 --> 00:15:24,013
- Aim for their eyes!
- Look out! Look out!

185
00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:25,053
Fall back!

186
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:29,293
The Republic ground troops
have been routed, Emir.

187
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:31,292
<i>What was that?</i>

188
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:33,772
I calculate the remaining clones

189
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:36,412
are attempting
a desperate final offensive.

190
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:39,212
Their chances of success
against us...

191
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:42,011
are 742:1.

192
00:15:42,411 --> 00:15:43,931
<i>You had better be right.</i>

193
00:15:44,572 --> 00:15:45,532
I am a droid.

194
00:15:46,171 --> 00:15:47,531
I am always right.

195
00:16:18,968 --> 00:16:19,928
No, wait.

196
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:35,526
- Incredible.
- Quiet, rookie.

197
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,446
Shoot the bridge!

198
00:16:59,923 --> 00:17:01,043
Don't shoot.

199
00:17:08,802 --> 00:17:11,282
Waxer, Boil,
where have you two slackers been?

200
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:13,602
Sir, there is an explanation.

201
00:17:13,682 --> 00:17:15,122
We got sidetracked.

202
00:17:17,842 --> 00:17:19,681
I think I see
what sidetracked you.

203
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,161
The clones have defeated
the creatures.

204
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,721
Yes, but their numbers are thin.

205
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:27,040
Prepare for their final attack.

206
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,321
Hello, little one.

207
00:17:30,721 --> 00:17:32,560
She brought us here
through the tunnels.

208
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,200
Knows her way around them
pretty good, sir.

209
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,639
The girl can lead us
through the tunnel to the prisoners.

210
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:46,959
Cody,
we're going to need a diversion.

211
00:18:03,437 --> 00:18:06,956
Yup, this is about the worst job
in the droid army.

212
00:18:09,077 --> 00:18:09,845
What?

213
00:18:09,942 --> 00:18:12,339
And it just went into overtime.

214
00:18:20,104 --> 00:18:22,569
I'll take care of this.
You keep her here.

215
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,730
There they are.
Let's go!

216
00:19:18,127 --> 00:19:19,526
Pull back! Pull back!

217
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,806
Commander, we have a problem.

218
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:29,166
<i>The Jedi is freeing the prisoners.</i>

219
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:42,764
Numa!

220
00:19:49,204 --> 00:19:50,923
Waxer, Boil,
come with me.

221
00:19:51,763 --> 00:19:53,043
We're with you, sir.

222
00:20:09,402 --> 00:20:10,601
Ready, General.

223
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,201
Setting Alpha five or six!

224
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,240
Where's the override?

225
00:20:56,997 --> 00:20:59,037
You lose, General Kenobi.

226
00:21:02,116 --> 00:21:04,596
Does not compute.
Does not compute.

227
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,236
Does not compute.
Does not compute...

228
00:21:28,713 --> 00:21:30,433
Great job
getting rid of those cannons.

229
00:21:30,553 --> 00:21:32,673
Now we have
a more difficult objective.

230
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:35,513
We must take the capital
and free this world.

231
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:37,912
See ya later, little one.

232
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:44,751
Hey, Numa.

233
00:21:45,711 --> 00:21:47,152
Stay out of trouble.

234
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:52,071
Don't be afraid.
We'll be back.

235
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:09,309
Sir, what is that
she keeps calling us?

236
00:22:09,469 --> 00:22:11,469
<i>Nerra.
It means "brother".</i>
