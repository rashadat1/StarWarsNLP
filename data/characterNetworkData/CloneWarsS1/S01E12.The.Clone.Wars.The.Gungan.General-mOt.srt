1
00:00:16,734 --> 00:00:18,374
<i>Dooku held for ransom!</i>

2
00:00:19,134 --> 00:00:21,614
<i>After escaping capture
by Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker</i>

3
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:23,453
<i>and Obi-Wan Kenobi,</i>

4
00:00:23,534 --> 00:00:26,414
<i>the villainous Count Dooku
fell into the clutches of pirates</i>

5
00:00:26,813 --> 00:00:28,653
<i>led by the brigand Hondo Ohnaka.</i>

6
00:00:29,053 --> 00:00:30,613
<i>Eager to get custody of Dooku,</i>

7
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:32,973
<i>the Republic agreed
to pay Hondo a hefty sum</i>

8
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:35,053
<i>in exchange for the Sith lord.</i>

9
00:00:35,212 --> 00:00:36,932
<i>But Anakin and Obi-Wan
had not counted</i>

10
00:00:37,092 --> 00:00:40,092
<i>on the treacherous cunning
of Ohnaka and his band.</i>

11
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:47,451
Master.

12
00:00:48,411 --> 00:00:49,531
What happened?

13
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:53,850
Well, I guess that pirate brew
is stronger than we thought.

14
00:00:54,251 --> 00:00:55,450
I only took a sip.

15
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,610
We were drugged, obviously.

16
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,770
Why would they risk
losing the ransom?

17
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,010
The deal appears to have changed.

18
00:01:02,089 --> 00:01:04,090
They must be trying to
triple their payday.

19
00:01:04,169 --> 00:01:07,449
A shrewd observation, Master Kenobi.

20
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:09,369
Great. It's you.

21
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:12,729
I did warn you
these pirates were devious.

22
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:15,649
You will notice our shackles
are bound together.

23
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:17,848
I have tried to separate us

24
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:19,848
to no avail.

25
00:01:20,168 --> 00:01:22,407
It's bad enough
we have to be in the same cell,

26
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:25,528
but could you at least spare me
the sound of your constant chatter?

27
00:01:25,687 --> 00:01:28,007
And while I hold my tongue,

28
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,967
the two of you will devise
a brilliant strategy

29
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:33,126
for getting off
this godforsaken planet?

30
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:34,486
- Yes!
- Yes!

31
00:01:34,806 --> 00:01:35,766
Excellent.

32
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:39,766
I told you
kidnapping the Sith lord

33
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:41,846
was a stroke of brilliance.

34
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:45,205
I can almost smell that spice now.

35
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:47,765
It'll be worth twice as much to us
on the black market.

36
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:51,604
But I think we could've gotten
a bigger ransom from the Separatists.

37
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:53,365
You fool.

38
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:56,164
Sometimes I wonder
why I bother to keep you around.

39
00:01:56,964 --> 00:02:00,803
If we tried to ransom Count Dooku off
to the Separatists,

40
00:02:01,044 --> 00:02:04,003
they would simply send
their droid armies here

41
00:02:04,164 --> 00:02:05,523
to wipe us out.

42
00:02:07,363 --> 00:02:10,163
Now, as my sweet mother always said,

43
00:02:10,802 --> 00:02:13,042
"Son, if one hostage is good,

44
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:14,723
"two are better.

45
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:17,682
"And three?
Well, that's just good business. "

46
00:02:18,642 --> 00:02:21,761
How much do you think they'll fetch?

47
00:02:21,882 --> 00:02:24,961
Don't you worry about how much.
You'll get your cut.

48
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:27,681
Just see to it
that the Republic's ransom gets here.

49
00:02:27,761 --> 00:02:29,761
Once we get the ransom for the Sith,

50
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:32,320
then we'll get the ransom
for the Jedi.

51
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,681
Thank you, mom.

52
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,200
The spice is on its way.

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,760
Hondo has asked me to go out
and meet the Republic senators

54
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,680
and bring them here with the ransom.

55
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,959
But I want you to intercept that ship
and force it down.

56
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,559
Be careful.

57
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,879
I want that spice intact.

58
00:02:52,638 --> 00:02:54,878
It's too risky.
What about Hondo?

59
00:02:55,438 --> 00:02:59,278
Yeah, that nitwit couldn't kill a nuna.
He depends on me for that.

60
00:02:59,358 --> 00:03:01,758
I'll tell him the ship was destroyed
with everyone on it,

61
00:03:01,837 --> 00:03:03,197
including the spice.

62
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:06,477
By the time he finds out the truth,
we'll be long gone.

63
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,196
<i>- ... and we'll be landing...
- Hidey-ho, Chancellor.</i>

64
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:16,636
<i>- Me-sa have a question.
- In a moment, Representative Binks.</i>

65
00:03:17,516 --> 00:03:19,676
Good work, Senator Kharrus.

66
00:03:19,836 --> 00:03:23,355
I am relieved you're about to arrive
at the pirates' stronghold safely.

67
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:26,875
Captain Hondo,
the leader of those brigands,

68
00:03:27,036 --> 00:03:28,555
will accept the ransom

69
00:03:28,795 --> 00:03:31,275
and turn Count Dooku
over to the Jedi.

70
00:03:31,355 --> 00:03:33,435
And then
they will bring him back with you.

71
00:03:33,674 --> 00:03:37,034
Once we've landed,
our signal will be strong enough

72
00:03:37,114 --> 00:03:39,434
to set up proper communications.

73
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,954
<i>Thank you, Senator.</i>

74
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,993
Senator Kharrus, Representative Binks,
take your seats.

75
00:03:48,073 --> 00:03:50,073
We are coming in for a landing.

76
00:03:50,473 --> 00:03:53,512
The last time I went
on one of these ransom missions,

77
00:03:53,992 --> 00:03:56,072
I spent three weeks in a dungeon.

78
00:03:57,192 --> 00:03:59,432
Representative Binks,
stop fooling around.

79
00:03:59,512 --> 00:04:01,751
We're landing.
Secure yourself.

80
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:03,271
Me-sa trying.

81
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:05,111
Is-sa stucken.

82
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,510
- We're under attack.
- We've been betrayed.

83
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,269
Missile closing.
Bank left!

84
00:04:37,908 --> 00:04:38,988
What the...?

85
00:04:39,748 --> 00:04:42,787
- Jar Jar, what are you doing?
- Sorry. Me-sa fix it.

86
00:04:43,347 --> 00:04:46,428
- Mack, what's going on back there?
- Sir, you must get out of the cockpit.

87
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:50,147
- We're hit!
- Sir, you must leave.

88
00:04:52,147 --> 00:04:53,746
Get back into your seat.

89
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:01,985
We're going down.

90
00:05:22,983 --> 00:05:26,383
Don't you think our priority
should be escape first, eat second?

91
00:05:31,423 --> 00:05:35,182
Do control your protege's insolence
so I can concentrate.

92
00:05:38,302 --> 00:05:39,582
- Anakin.
- What?

93
00:05:39,662 --> 00:05:43,022
Control your insolence.
The count is concentrating.

94
00:05:50,461 --> 00:05:53,020
Well done, if I do say so myself.

95
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:54,780
Most impressive.

96
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:09,819
Me-sa no see-a Senator Kharrus.

97
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:12,219
Pilots are dead.

98
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:15,498
Sir, over here.
I found the senator.

99
00:06:21,018 --> 00:06:22,138
He can't be dead.

100
00:06:22,698 --> 00:06:25,578
We've got to figure out
a way to contact Coruscant.

101
00:06:28,377 --> 00:06:30,136
They crashed into Doshar field.

102
00:06:30,617 --> 00:06:33,896
Good, good.
And you have the spice?

103
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:36,936
No, not exactly. No.

104
00:06:37,016 --> 00:06:38,856
I think there are survivors.

105
00:06:39,176 --> 00:06:42,296
We have to call it off.
Maybe we should tell Hondo.

106
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,776
No one tells Hondo anything!

107
00:06:45,176 --> 00:06:47,735
If anyone survived that crash,
we'll take care of 'em.

108
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:50,215
Trust me,

109
00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:52,695
we're getting that spice.

110
00:07:01,174 --> 00:07:04,613
We do know where we're going,
don't we?

111
00:07:04,773 --> 00:07:05,813
Hush, Anakin.

112
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:07,893
Do we know where we're going?

113
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,013
Quiet.

114
00:07:09,813 --> 00:07:13,573
I was brought this way
when I was captured. It was open then.

115
00:07:14,373 --> 00:07:15,732
I found the door key.

116
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:19,812
This is the way to the hangar.

117
00:07:19,892 --> 00:07:22,612
Yes, but are you sure it's safe?

118
00:07:22,772 --> 00:07:24,852
- The key works.
- Is it safe?

119
00:07:25,331 --> 00:07:26,612
Of course it is.

120
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:28,531
Right.

121
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:33,731
Hold it right there, Jedi.

122
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,730
What were we thinking,
following a Sith lord?

123
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,769
Oh, what to do,
what to do, what to do?

124
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:51,129
I don't want to kill you, per se.

125
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:54,528
In fact,
you seem like decent fellows.

126
00:07:54,928 --> 00:07:57,608
Even you, Count.
This is just business,

127
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:01,288
and once I get my money,
we can go back to being friends.

128
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,528
It's very simple.

129
00:08:03,687 --> 00:08:07,207
Now, try not to complicate things
by breaking out again.

130
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:15,007
We have to get out of here before
the Republic arrives with the ransom.

131
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:17,206
For once, I agree with you.

132
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:30,125
- Any luck repairing the homing beacon?
- No, sir.

133
00:08:34,164 --> 00:08:35,924
You-sa find rest, Senator.

134
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:38,924
Thosen with good in their heart

135
00:08:39,044 --> 00:08:40,884
always passen too soon.

136
00:08:42,324 --> 00:08:46,164
Sir, with the death of Senator Kharrus,
are you now in command of the mission?

137
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:47,843
Technically, no.

138
00:08:48,323 --> 00:08:50,043
Then, who is?

139
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:53,642
Representative Binks
is the highest-ranking person here.

140
00:08:53,803 --> 00:08:56,802
- We be missing you, Senator.
- Sir, this place is dangerous.

141
00:08:56,962 --> 00:08:59,442
Look, those geysers
are spitting out acid.

142
00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:03,722
These-a beasties
don't like the geysers neither.

143
00:09:06,521 --> 00:09:07,881
What is it, Sergeant?

144
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:11,681
How are we gonna deliver the ransom
to the Jedi and get Count Dooku back?

145
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,281
You do not want to stand guard.

146
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,640
I do not want to stand guard.

147
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,319
You want to deactivate the cell bars

148
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,839
and go out drinking.

149
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,079
I want to deactivate the cell bars

150
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:31,479
and go out drinking.

151
00:09:34,638 --> 00:09:35,598
Not bad.

152
00:09:35,838 --> 00:09:39,158
Yes, most impressive, Master Kenobi.

153
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:42,598
What's-a that?

154
00:09:47,597 --> 00:09:49,037
You think this is trouble, sir?

155
00:09:49,397 --> 00:09:51,917
They could be the ones
we're supposed to deliver the ransom to.

156
00:09:52,036 --> 00:09:54,597
Or they-sa the ones
that be shooting us down.

157
00:09:59,476 --> 00:10:02,516
You're right, Binks. Incoming!
Form a circle!

158
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:13,075
There's not enough cover out here.

159
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:15,754
They're cutting us off
from the shuttle.

160
00:10:16,794 --> 00:10:18,314
We've got to regroup.

161
00:10:22,274 --> 00:10:23,794
Follow me. Let's hide.

162
00:10:24,594 --> 00:10:25,673
Come on, men.

163
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:35,873
Where'd they go?

164
00:10:35,993 --> 00:10:38,272
I don't know.
Maybe they fell in a crater.

165
00:10:39,992 --> 00:10:41,152
Find the spice.

166
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:43,392
Should we look for the clones
in the crater?

167
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:44,711
Get back here.

168
00:10:44,831 --> 00:10:46,951
Once that geyser goes off,
they're broiled.

169
00:10:49,871 --> 00:10:52,351
- We're not gonna last long in here.
- Don't worry.

170
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:54,990
As long as those beasties
are up there, we're safe.

171
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,790
When they run, we run.

172
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,630
See? Me-sa knew it was safe,
since the beasties are nearby.

173
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,668
Come on, let's go!

174
00:11:33,347 --> 00:11:35,706
Commander, you're right.
The ransom's gone.

175
00:11:37,386 --> 00:11:39,466
I suggest we stay here
and wait for the Republic

176
00:11:39,586 --> 00:11:41,826
- to send a rescue party.
- We-sa can't wait.

177
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:43,986
We don't have much choice.

178
00:11:44,426 --> 00:11:46,946
Ani and Obi are waiting for us
to deliver the spicen.

179
00:11:47,346 --> 00:11:49,985
Those pirates are on speeders.
How are we gonna catch them?

180
00:11:50,705 --> 00:11:52,304
Me-sa be having an idea.

181
00:11:58,704 --> 00:12:00,184
Hurry it up, Dooku.

182
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:08,023
You should be more patient, Master.

183
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:10,703
After all, the count
is an elderly gentleman

184
00:12:10,823 --> 00:12:13,943
- and doesn't move like he used to.
- I suppose you're right.

185
00:12:14,343 --> 00:12:16,342
I would kill you both right now

186
00:12:16,462 --> 00:12:19,062
if I did not have to
drag your bodies.

187
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:25,141
Look! There they are.

188
00:12:25,742 --> 00:12:26,702
Giddy up!

189
00:12:57,178 --> 00:12:59,738
Let him go, sir.
We've got the spice back.

190
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:08,457
Now we just have to
get beyond that wall.

191
00:13:08,937 --> 00:13:09,977
Let's go!

192
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,616
This is not going well.

193
00:13:27,895 --> 00:13:29,495
Don't let them get away!

194
00:13:35,494 --> 00:13:37,294
Hey, what are you guys doing?

195
00:13:38,254 --> 00:13:40,374
You're too heavy.
I can't do it.

196
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,014
Drop Dooku!

197
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:48,574
I guess this means
we won't be friends.

198
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:54,773
Right, now that we have the spice,
we need to find the compound.

199
00:13:54,893 --> 00:13:56,933
- Anything to the south?
- Nothing, sir.

200
00:13:57,052 --> 00:14:00,052
Who knows where
that pirate stronghold is from here.

201
00:14:00,332 --> 00:14:01,812
Well, look at that.

202
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:03,571
Power lines.

203
00:14:04,372 --> 00:14:05,795
They must lead somewhere.

204
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:08,571
There's-a power,
there's-a be people too.

205
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,170
Captain!

206
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,491
Well, Turk,

207
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,810
did the Republic arrive
with my spice?

208
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,449
The Republic deceived us.

209
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,290
They didn't send the ransom,
they sent an army.

210
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,090
They ambushed us in Doshar field.

211
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,209
I suggest we counterattack
with tanks.

212
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:33,728
- Where are your men?
- I was the only survivor.

213
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:36,449
I think they will attack us
to try and free the Jedi.

214
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:39,568
I warned them.

215
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:42,848
I didn't want
to torture anyone.

216
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:45,527
But now?
Even in a galaxy at war...

217
00:14:46,448 --> 00:14:48,368
you hope to find some honor.

218
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:51,247
Let me take our tanks.
I'll make 'em pay.

219
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:54,767
Go. Stop them before they reach
the compound.

220
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:57,167
I will deal with the Jedi.

221
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:58,846
Yes, Captain.

222
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,806
We have to find a way out of here

223
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:05,725
before Senator Kharrus
and Jar Jar arrive.

224
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:07,365
We'll look like fools.

225
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:10,405
I think it's time
to lose the dead weight.

226
00:15:13,644 --> 00:15:15,044
You two, come with us.

227
00:15:23,564 --> 00:15:26,524
There be some bombad clankens
coming this-a way.

228
00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:29,203
What?
Bombad clankens?

229
00:15:29,883 --> 00:15:30,883
Right there!

230
00:15:31,003 --> 00:15:32,283
- Where?
- There!

231
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,403
- Wait!
- Over there! Come on! There!

232
00:15:36,923 --> 00:15:39,202
You're right.
Bombad clankers.

233
00:15:43,202 --> 00:15:46,082
Representative Binks,
we're going to need your services

234
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:49,041
- for this part of the mission.
- Who-sa? Me-sa?

235
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:52,001
Yes, sir.
You are the Senate representative.

236
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,721
We need you to go out there
and negotiate with the pirates.

237
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,840
Me-sa no liken this idea,

238
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,880
but I think is-sa
what Senator Kharrus woulda do-sa.

239
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:05,000
He's probably going
to get himself killed.

240
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,559
Don't worry.
He's smarter than he looks.

241
00:16:17,038 --> 00:16:19,798
I take it the Republic didn't arrive
with the ransom.

242
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:25,998
Your Republic obviously doesn't want

243
00:16:26,477 --> 00:16:27,637
the Sith lord.

244
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:29,117
They didn't show?

245
00:16:30,397 --> 00:16:32,077
They did.
They did show...

246
00:16:32,197 --> 00:16:34,957
...with a huge army
that they thought would be enough

247
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,036
to get the better of me,

248
00:16:37,436 --> 00:16:39,477
- Hondo!
- That can't be right.

249
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:41,316
Are you calling me a liar?

250
00:16:41,996 --> 00:16:43,956
Isn't that kind of what you do
for a living?

251
00:16:44,676 --> 00:16:46,876
You reject my hospitality,

252
00:16:47,276 --> 00:16:49,795
refuse to wait in your cell,

253
00:16:50,355 --> 00:16:53,555
and now
you're going to insult me?

254
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:55,755
- I'm just saying.
- Anakin.

255
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,514
What? He is a pirate.

256
00:16:57,754 --> 00:17:01,394
Yes, but this may not be the best time
for you to speak.

257
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,594
- But you...
- At all, Anakin!

258
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,673
What are you supposed to be?

259
00:17:16,712 --> 00:17:18,553
Me-sa Representative Binks.

260
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,672
Me-sa coming to deliver the spicen.

261
00:17:21,992 --> 00:17:24,071
Where's the army Turk reported?

262
00:17:24,432 --> 00:17:25,512
Don't know.

263
00:17:25,672 --> 00:17:27,911
Let's fry this one
and look around.

264
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:30,671
No, if he's a representative,

265
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:33,511
he might be worth something as well.

266
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,831
You, Representative Bink,

267
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,871
we'll take you to your Jedi friends

268
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,231
so you can... negotiate.

269
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,030
Okey-day.

270
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:47,230
Sir, they're taking

271
00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:49,830
- Representative Binks hostage.
- Get ready.

272
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:57,268
Sorry. Sorry!

273
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:10,828
What happened to the power?
I was having fun.

274
00:18:21,706 --> 00:18:22,786
What the...?

275
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,024
Hold it right there.

276
00:18:39,784 --> 00:18:41,184
Kill him. Kill him!

277
00:18:41,624 --> 00:18:43,984
He's no representative.
He's a plague!

278
00:18:44,784 --> 00:18:46,383
Who's-a plague-a? Me-sa?

279
00:18:47,824 --> 00:18:50,703
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Nice work, sir!

280
00:18:56,743 --> 00:18:58,302
We're leaving without the spice?

281
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:02,222
It won't be long until Hondo
figures out what's happened.

282
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:10,781
What are you doing?

283
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,860
What chance
do you really have, Jedi?

284
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,820
Now let me go,

285
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,100
and I might let you live.

286
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,499
Approach us, and he dies.

287
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:34,778
Looks like your forces
were destroyed, Jedi.

288
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:37,179
Ani! Obi!

289
00:19:38,098 --> 00:19:38,979
Jar Jar?

290
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:41,178
Me-sa have arrived with the spicen.

291
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:45,378
Excellent, Jar Jar, assuming
the pirates still have Count Dooku to trade.

292
00:19:52,736 --> 00:19:54,897
Well, that answers that question.

293
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:02,016
Commander,
start the engines, please.

294
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:03,776
So what now, Jedi?

295
00:20:04,815 --> 00:20:06,816
You're going to arrest me?

296
00:20:07,695 --> 00:20:10,175
- No. Anakin, release him.
- What?

297
00:20:10,735 --> 00:20:12,535
Captain,
you have nothing we want,

298
00:20:12,655 --> 00:20:15,654
and since we're not prisoners anymore,
you have no bargaining power.

299
00:20:15,774 --> 00:20:18,014
What?
You-sa was in bombad trouble?

300
00:20:18,574 --> 00:20:19,774
Me-sa rescued you.

301
00:20:20,295 --> 00:20:22,734
No, Jar Jar.
We weren't in any trouble.

302
00:20:23,574 --> 00:20:25,294
Let's leave on even terms.

303
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:29,093
Hold. Hold!

304
00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:30,493
Jedi,

305
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,133
after everything,

306
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,733
you're just going to walk away?

307
00:20:35,293 --> 00:20:38,093
We have no quarrel with you,
and we seek no revenge.

308
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:42,532
Indeed very honorable,
Master Jedi.

309
00:20:43,211 --> 00:20:44,052
Oh, Captain,

310
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:47,611
you will find that Count Dooku
does not share our sense of honor,

311
00:20:47,731 --> 00:20:49,772
and he knows where you live.
