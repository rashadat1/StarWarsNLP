1
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:18,895
<i>Missing in action!</i>

2
00:00:19,534 --> 00:00:24,174
<i>Anakin Skywalker's heroic droid navigator
R2-D2 was lost in battle.</i>

3
00:00:24,494 --> 00:00:26,861
<i>When a desperate search fails
to locate R2,</i>

4
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:30,893
<i>Anakin is forced to take on
a new navigator, R3-S6.</i>

5
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:33,773
<i>Now the Jedi embark
on a dangerous new mission...</i>

6
00:00:33,813 --> 00:00:35,814
<i>to find a secret enemy listening post.</i>

7
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:41,052
<i>Meanwhile, R2-D2 has fallen
into the hands of a vile droid smuggler</i>

8
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:43,572
<i>and is on his way
to General Grievous...</i>

9
00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:47,252
<i>who will surely plunder
the Republic's secrets hidden within him.</i>

10
00:00:53,092 --> 00:00:55,451
I am entering your orbit now, General.

11
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:57,851
I will be at your station shortly.

12
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,451
And, General...

13
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:01,531
<i>What is it, Gha Nachkt?</i>

14
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,891
I prefer to get my reward in cash.

15
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,290
We've searched their supply grids, sir.

16
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,169
There's nothing to indicate
the presence of an enemy outpost.

17
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:36,008
Huh?

18
00:01:39,087 --> 00:01:42,527
Master, I'm receiving
a strange transmission.

19
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,967
I can't seem to make it out, though.

20
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:46,966
Boost the volume, Goldie.

21
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,646
No, you're losing it.

22
00:01:54,646 --> 00:01:55,405
That's R2.

23
00:01:55,486 --> 00:01:58,005
Uh, that doesn't sound like R2.

24
00:01:58,038 --> 00:01:58,651
It's him.

25
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,285
I could never forget that voice.

26
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,245
Trace it, Rex.

27
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:02,205
Sir.

28
00:02:02,365 --> 00:02:04,324
What is going on here?

29
00:02:08,564 --> 00:02:10,764
You sneaky little scrap pile.

30
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:16,044
You'd better be worth all this trouble.

31
00:02:20,163 --> 00:02:23,123
Master, our orders were
to find the Separatist listening post.

32
00:02:23,163 --> 00:02:25,442
Perhaps R2 is at the listening post.

33
00:02:25,682 --> 00:02:26,682
Did you consider that?

34
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:29,722
We have a lock on the droid's location, sir.

35
00:02:29,962 --> 00:02:31,441
Prepare to jump to those coordinates.

36
00:02:31,562 --> 00:02:32,202
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:36,681
Hold on, R2, old buddy.

38
00:02:36,762 --> 00:02:37,722
We're coming.

39
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:49,121
<i>What is it, Gha Nachkt?</i>

40
00:02:49,154 --> 00:02:50,127
I've arrived.

41
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,520
Could you lower your shields?

42
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,718
Keep moving, grease spot.

43
00:03:12,718 --> 00:03:13,798
Aah.

44
00:03:14,517 --> 00:03:18,277
This is the droid
those Jedi came looking for, General.

45
00:03:18,478 --> 00:03:22,357
What secrets do you carry, my little friend?

46
00:03:24,197 --> 00:03:25,957
So defiant.

47
00:03:26,036 --> 00:03:27,723
No need for fear.

48
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:29,956
We're all droids here.

49
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:32,963
Rip this little rat apart,

50
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:34,916
and find out everything he knows.

51
00:03:38,036 --> 00:03:39,436
Right away, General.

52
00:03:51,154 --> 00:03:54,434
Sir, the last transmission came from
that moon's upper atmosphere,

53
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:55,434
directly ahead.

54
00:03:57,313 --> 00:03:59,034
That's a Separatist battle sphere.

55
00:03:59,393 --> 00:04:01,313
I'm picking up a lot of encrypted chatter.

56
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:02,793
Contact Obi-Wan.

57
00:04:02,953 --> 00:04:06,393
Stubby, scramble secret code set 1477.

58
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:09,073
I don't want that station to pick this up.

59
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:13,193
<i>Anakin?</i>

60
00:04:13,392 --> 00:04:16,272
Master, I believe we've found
your Separatist listening post.

61
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:17,438
<i>Excellent work.</i>

62
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:18,558
<i>Back off and wait.</i>

63
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,112
<i>I'll send two mainline cruisers
to help you destroy it.</i>

64
00:04:21,152 --> 00:04:21,952
But R2...

65
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:24,431
We believe my droid, R2, is on board.

66
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:25,671
He's the one that led us here.

67
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:29,071
<i>Hmm, this complicates things.</i>

68
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:31,790
<i>You must sneak aboard that station
and destroy it</i>

69
00:04:31,824 --> 00:04:33,750
<i>before they crack R2's memory banks.</i>

70
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,750
<i>I know you're fond of that droid,</i>

71
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:37,550
<i>but he's fallen into enemy hands.</i>

72
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,829
I could rescue R2.

73
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,629
<i>No, this is not a rescue mission.</i>

74
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:45,269
Keep jamming their scanners.

75
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:47,149
If they spot us, we're dead.

76
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,708
We're bringing the droid?

77
00:04:58,948 --> 00:05:02,907
We'll need Goldie to open secured hatches
and access the station's computer for us.

78
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:06,027
Oh, and, Rex...
you get to carry him.

79
00:05:09,306 --> 00:05:10,706
Ah, that's just great.

80
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,185
Follow me, boys!

81
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,783
Take this upstairs,
and be sure not to drop it.

82
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:52,262
Whoa!
Ow.

83
00:05:54,582 --> 00:05:57,822
Those 631s are not
the brightest lights on the ship.

84
00:06:06,221 --> 00:06:08,781
Next time, you're lugging
this astromech around.

85
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,940
All this moisture is corroding
my servo-motors.

86
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:24,279
Go up to level eight.

87
00:06:24,312 --> 00:06:25,459
Get your head adjusted.

88
00:06:25,493 --> 00:06:26,579
It feels great.

89
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,819
That'll feel gr-

90
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:29,419
What the...?

91
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:37,899
All right, Stubby.
Get to work.

92
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:42,538
We are here.

93
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:45,777
The reactors are 30 levels below us, there.

94
00:06:46,177 --> 00:06:48,937
Ahsoka, you take the squad
and blow up those reactors.

95
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:50,097
Gravity will do the rest.

96
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:51,337
We'll meet in the landing bay.

97
00:06:51,657 --> 00:06:52,657
Where are you going?

98
00:06:53,097 --> 00:06:55,177
I'm just going to
have a little look around.

99
00:06:55,336 --> 00:06:57,696
I hope you find R2 in one piece.

100
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:07,056
This is...
This is...!

101
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:08,415
General Grievous!

102
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:10,495
What is it?

103
00:07:10,655 --> 00:07:14,375
It appears this droid's mission memory
has never been erased.

104
00:07:14,615 --> 00:07:19,134
It contains every Republic formation
and strategy they have.

105
00:07:20,614 --> 00:07:21,660
Good work.

106
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:24,654
You certainly earned your fee this time.

107
00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:26,620
More than my fee.

108
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,973
This droid is worth more,
I get paid more.

109
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:31,293
Now, I suggest-

110
00:07:35,013 --> 00:07:36,733
There is your bonus.

111
00:07:47,932 --> 00:07:50,211
Report, agent R3.

112
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:53,531
The Jedi are here?

113
00:07:53,771 --> 00:07:55,651
<i>Delay them until I arrive.</i>

114
00:07:57,171 --> 00:07:58,931
Goldie, where are you?

115
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,570
Sound the alarm.

116
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,969
What are you doing back here?

117
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,170
Come on.

118
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,769
Now we will transfer all your secrets to me.

119
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:19,769
Don't worry.
I won't let anything happen to you.

120
00:08:25,128 --> 00:08:27,767
Republic troops have infiltrated the base.

121
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:29,687
Keep this droid secure.

122
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:33,967
I will deal with the Jedi myself.

123
00:08:42,446 --> 00:08:43,806
We found the reactor room, sir.

124
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:46,007
<i>The alarm triggered
another security door...</i>

125
00:08:46,488 --> 00:08:47,639
...ray-shielded.

126
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:50,046
This could take a while to bypass.

127
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,062
Good luck with that.

128
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:52,150
Go ahead, Goldie.

129
00:08:52,184 --> 00:08:53,205
Make me proud.

130
00:08:56,045 --> 00:08:57,205
Oh, this'll be good.

131
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,564
Those droids are getting close, sir.

132
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,403
Do you think R3's going to
open up that door any time soon?

133
00:09:07,724 --> 00:09:09,043
He's working on it.

134
00:09:09,077 --> 00:09:10,364
Patience, Captain.

135
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:14,923
I can always hot-wire it, sir.

136
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:16,363
Hurry up, Goldie.

137
00:09:18,163 --> 00:09:19,523
I think we've run out of time.

138
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:20,602
Blast 'em!

139
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,720
Rex, droid poppers, now!

140
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,040
Droid poppers!

141
00:10:11,638 --> 00:10:14,357
<i>Take the captured R2 unit to my ship.</i>

142
00:10:20,717 --> 00:10:23,716
They sent a child to destroy my station?

143
00:10:24,277 --> 00:10:26,636
The Republic must be running out of Jedi.

144
00:10:27,477 --> 00:10:29,556
You must be General Grievous.

145
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:33,876
He's just another tinny, boys.

146
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:36,236
Let's scrap him like the rest.

147
00:10:55,473 --> 00:10:57,473
Sorry to interrupt your playtime, grumpy,

148
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:59,393
but wouldn't you prefer a challenge?

149
00:10:59,553 --> 00:11:01,273
That wouldn't be you.

150
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:24,751
All units, stay on high alert.

151
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,270
Watch out for a second Jedi
loose in the station.

152
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,909
R2!

153
00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:42,229
Hang on, R2!

154
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:53,028
Where is the fight
you promised me, youngling?

155
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:04,866
Ahsoka, it's me, Rex.

156
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:06,206
There are only two of us left.

157
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,386
Should we abort the mission?

158
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:09,146
No, complete the mission.

159
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:11,546
Set the charges
and rendezvous at the landing bay.

160
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:12,346
<i>But, sir...</i>

161
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:13,826
That's an order, Rex.

162
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:15,106
I'll keep the general busy.

163
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:16,466
Ahsoka out.

164
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:18,271
She's distracting Grievous.

165
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,385
Come on.
We still got a job to do.

166
00:12:21,945 --> 00:12:23,545
Come here, child.

167
00:12:23,665 --> 00:12:25,225
I'm looking for you.

168
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:28,384
So far, you have failed to impress me.

169
00:12:29,424 --> 00:12:30,944
Goldie, over here.

170
00:12:32,744 --> 00:12:33,784
Goldie, no!

171
00:12:35,024 --> 00:12:36,944
<i>Ahsoka, we're in the reactor-</i>

172
00:12:38,943 --> 00:12:40,663
Your friends won't help you.

173
00:12:40,784 --> 00:12:42,304
You're stuck with me.

174
00:12:55,662 --> 00:12:57,261
You have something that belongs to me.

175
00:13:35,818 --> 00:13:36,818
Thanks, R2.

176
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:39,777
It's great to see you too, buddy.

177
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:41,457
You don't look so good.
You okay?

178
00:13:46,857 --> 00:13:48,537
Rex?
Rex, can you hear me?

179
00:13:48,657 --> 00:13:50,577
R3? R3, is that you?

180
00:13:51,016 --> 00:13:51,856
I've got R2.

181
00:13:52,256 --> 00:13:53,696
I'll meet you back at the landing bay.

182
00:13:56,776 --> 00:13:57,360
R3?

183
00:13:57,456 --> 00:13:59,736
Uh, yeah,
I had to get a replacement droid.

184
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:01,136
Look, sorry, R2.

185
00:14:02,295 --> 00:14:03,616
It was Obi-Wan's idea.

186
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:05,695
Look, we'll talk about this later.

187
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:07,255
Twilight, this is Skywalker.

188
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,975
<i>Rendezvous at the south landing bay
immediately for evacuation.</i>

189
00:14:12,054 --> 00:14:13,055
Acknowledged, General.

190
00:14:13,088 --> 00:14:14,374
I'm on my way.

191
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,694
R3, what have you to report?

192
00:14:25,453 --> 00:14:27,893
That stubby little backstabber.

193
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:31,253
So Skywalker has come
for his R2 unit.

194
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:35,052
Go and make certain
they do not escape.

195
00:14:48,051 --> 00:14:49,491
Great, there's the Twilight.

196
00:14:49,531 --> 00:14:50,531
Now where's everyone else?

197
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:54,690
Sir.

198
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,170
Hey, Stubby, where's Ahsoka?

199
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,410
General Skywalker.

200
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:03,889
Explosives are in place, sir.

201
00:15:03,923 --> 00:15:04,969
Objective completed.

202
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:06,249
Where is Ahsoka?

203
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:07,810
She engaged General Grievous.

204
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:08,809
Alone?

205
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,209
She distracted him
while we completed the mission.

206
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:12,768
It was on her orders, sir.

207
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:14,129
The droid was with her.

208
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:16,289
- We've got to find her.
- I can take you to her, sir.

209
00:15:24,447 --> 00:15:25,687
What is the matter with you?

210
00:15:25,768 --> 00:15:27,327
Are you trying to get us killed?

211
00:15:39,766 --> 00:15:42,525
I've got a bad feeling about this, sir.

212
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:45,685
That double-crossing droid is a spy.

213
00:16:17,483 --> 00:16:20,682
Another lightsaber to add to my collection.

214
00:16:21,002 --> 00:16:22,962
My spy droid, R3,

215
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,402
has trapped your precious master.

216
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:28,961
When I'm finished with you,
he's next.

217
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:30,041
You're wrong.

218
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:31,681
He's gone by now,

219
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:35,480
and he's going to blow up
your precious spy station.

220
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,560
Not this time.

221
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,840
Captain, trigger the explosives.

222
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:49,199
But, sir,
we're still in the station.

223
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,399
You just let me worry about the details.

224
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,559
Sir, yes, sir.

225
00:17:19,477 --> 00:17:21,636
R2, I need you
to get the hangar door open.

226
00:17:22,716 --> 00:17:24,676
See if there are any controls
on the outer platform.

227
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:20,710
So, what did I miss?

228
00:18:21,431 --> 00:18:22,710
Oh, the usual.

229
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,190
It was foolish of you
to take on Grievous by yourself.

230
00:18:27,224 --> 00:18:29,716
Well, I was leading the mission,

231
00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:31,789
and it seemed like a good idea
at the time.

232
00:18:37,668 --> 00:18:40,789
Did he tell you your stubby
little gold droid pal works for him?

233
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:43,028
He might have mentioned it.

234
00:18:43,228 --> 00:18:44,948
I guess we were all fooled.

235
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:50,908
General Skywalker,
there are fuel cells over here.

236
00:18:51,107 --> 00:18:52,067
Get ready, Rex.

237
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:04,787
- R2 did it.
- Of course he did it.

238
00:19:04,826 --> 00:19:06,026
Now let's get out of here.

239
00:19:08,986 --> 00:19:10,346
R2, where are you?

240
00:19:29,144 --> 00:19:30,903
General Skywalker has
gotten into his fighter.

241
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:31,824
Where's he going?

242
00:19:32,024 --> 00:19:33,744
He's going after R2.

243
00:19:33,903 --> 00:19:36,183
I'll be right back.
Don't wait for me.

244
00:20:00,461 --> 00:20:01,421
Come on, R2.

245
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:20,859
<i>So, let me get this straight, Anakin.</i>

246
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:23,538
<i>You risked the mission,
all your men,</i>

247
00:20:23,698 --> 00:20:25,378
<i>even your padawan,</i>

248
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:27,018
<i>to save a droid.</i>

249
00:20:28,338 --> 00:20:30,058
R2 found the listening post,

250
00:20:30,092 --> 00:20:31,464
and he saved our lives.

251
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:33,417
We couldn't just leave him there,
Obi-Wan.

252
00:20:33,577 --> 00:20:36,138
<i>Oh, Anakin. One day...</i>

253
00:20:37,658 --> 00:20:39,657
I'm glad we got R2 back, Master.

254
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,817
But Obi-Wan does have a point.

255
00:20:41,937 --> 00:20:44,097
Ahsoka, I knew you would
complete the mission.

256
00:20:44,256 --> 00:20:46,896
Besides,
R2 is more than a droid.

257
00:20:47,136 --> 00:20:48,176
He's a friend.
