1
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,837
<i>A deadly weapon unleashed!</i>

2
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:20,834
<i>The Separatist battleship Malevolence</i>

3
00:00:20,986 --> 00:00:23,221
<i>advances unopposed to Republic space,</i>

4
00:00:23,336 --> 00:00:26,127
<i>tearing apart any ship
that stands in its path.</i>

5
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:28,861
<i>After a daring rescue
and narrow escape,</i>

6
00:00:29,206 --> 00:00:32,416
<i>Anakin Skywalker prepares
a counter-attack on the enemy ship</i>

7
00:00:32,568 --> 00:00:34,612
<i>and its diabolical droid commander...</i>

8
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:37,368
<i>General Grievous.</i>

9
00:00:46,393 --> 00:00:48,699
This strike force has been
commisioned by the senate

10
00:00:48,813 --> 00:00:50,795
to hunt down
the enemy's new battleship.

11
00:00:51,173 --> 00:00:54,015
As the bulk of our fleets are
engaged on the front lines,

12
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,301
we'll be on our own.

13
00:00:55,636 --> 00:00:58,460
General Skywalker has
prepared our attack strategy.

14
00:00:58,576 --> 00:00:59,718
Thank you, Admiral.

15
00:00:59,832 --> 00:01:02,394
While our capital ships are
vulnerable to the enemy's attack,

16
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,272
I believe a squad of bombers
can outmaneuvre their ion weapon.

17
00:01:05,387 --> 00:01:07,960
Our target would be the bridge
and General Grievous.

18
00:01:11,556 --> 00:01:12,984
The head clanker.

19
00:01:13,187 --> 00:01:15,360
Skywalker's getting pretty ambitious.

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,233
Our bombers will attack at high speed
to evade the enemy's ion weapon.

21
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:22,469
We'll concentrate our firepower
on the bridge super-structure, here.

22
00:01:22,762 --> 00:01:26,071
We destroy General Grievous,
his ship will fall with him.

23
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:27,127
Any questions?

24
00:01:27,224 --> 00:01:29,334
Just tell us
where that metalhead is, sir.

25
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:32,021
Yeah, we've been waiting
for a chance to take him out.

26
00:01:32,117 --> 00:01:33,844
All right, men.
Settle down.

27
00:01:33,941 --> 00:01:35,188
This is an important mission.

28
00:01:35,477 --> 00:01:39,218
We destroy Grievous,
we can bring the war to a quicker end.

29
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,554
Pilots, prepare your bombers.

30
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,670
Skywalker,

31
00:01:43,824 --> 00:01:45,747
this is an aggressive plan.

32
00:01:45,861 --> 00:01:48,661
Are you sure your squadron
can complete this mission?

33
00:01:48,844 --> 00:01:49,911
Let's ask them.

34
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,016
Matchstick,
you think our boys can pull it off?

35
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:54,200
Yes, sir.

36
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:57,033
There hasn't been a mission
Shadow squadron couldn't complete.

37
00:01:57,148 --> 00:02:00,875
That's right. Minimal casualties,
maximum effectiveness - that's us.

38
00:02:01,156 --> 00:02:03,176
I admire your confidence, pilot.

39
00:02:03,698 --> 00:02:06,763
Even so,
minimal casualties may be enough

40
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:09,725
to prevent you from
breaking Grievous' defenses.

41
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:13,742
Master Plo is right.
With Grievous on that ship's bridge,

42
00:02:13,937 --> 00:02:16,828
- it's bound to be well-protected.
- Don't worry, Ahsoka.

43
00:02:16,943 --> 00:02:19,710
We'll destroy that bridge
and Grievous along with it.

44
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:26,971
Master Skywalker seems to
inspire great confidence in his men.

45
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:30,574
He does lead by example.

46
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,728
So much for the Jedi escort.

47
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:59,085
The last transport is fleeing, General.

48
00:02:59,182 --> 00:03:00,813
You've got them on the run.

49
00:03:05,322 --> 00:03:06,857
They won't get far.

50
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,929
Charge the plasma rotors.

51
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:17,276
- They're moving to attack position, sir.
- Still setting the coordinates.

52
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:19,234
Are we clear to make
the jump to hyperspace?

53
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:22,692
Fire ion weapon.

54
00:03:28,452 --> 00:03:30,137
We've lost all power.

55
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:39,849
Boy, this is a lot more fun
when they're not shooting back.

56
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:42,158
I still can't seem to hit anything.

57
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,857
<i>Grievous,
those battle droids are expensive.</i>

58
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:50,027
<i>The Jedi are never
that harsh with their clones.</i>

59
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:55,370
The care these Jedi show
for their troops is a weakness.

60
00:03:55,983 --> 00:03:59,088
<i>A weakness
we shall continue to exploit.</i>

61
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:02,175
<i>I have the coordinates for a new target.</i>

62
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:06,294
<i>The Republic's secret
Outer Rim medical station.</i>

63
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:11,086
<i>It is unprotected and
treating over 60,000 wounded clones.</i>

64
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:14,709
<i>We will do them a favor
and put them out of their misery.</i>

65
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:16,478
<i>Once you have destroyed it,</i>

66
00:04:16,575 --> 00:04:20,414
<i>there will be nowhere for the Jedi
to send their wounded,</i>

67
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:22,017
<i>and they will die.</i>

68
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:24,813
It will be a pleasure, my lord.

69
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:29,801
<i>I feel very confident leaving the ship
under your command, General.</i>

70
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:31,969
General.

71
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:43,042
Target those escape pods.
I have a reputation to uphold.

72
00:04:52,046 --> 00:04:55,125
- Which one's mine?
- You're with me. You'll be my gunner.

73
00:04:56,972 --> 00:05:00,259
- Somebody's got to watch my back.
- Broadside could do that.

74
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,154
Besides, you have R2.

75
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,829
But I so enjoy your company,
my padawan.

76
00:05:05,982 --> 00:05:09,039
Just admit it.
You don't like my flying.

77
00:05:09,298 --> 00:05:11,626
No, it's not that.
It's just, I...

78
00:05:11,673 --> 00:05:14,120
Skywalker, the enemy warship
has attacked our convoy

79
00:05:14,236 --> 00:05:15,889
of medical transports
near Ryndellia.

80
00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:17,607
Medical transports?

81
00:05:18,073 --> 00:05:21,399
Only General Grievous would go
after clones who can't fight back.

82
00:05:21,514 --> 00:05:23,439
The Ryndellia system...
Near Naboo.

83
00:05:23,787 --> 00:05:27,511
Isn't that where our medical base is?
I'll bet that will be his next target.

84
00:05:27,842 --> 00:05:30,335
There are many star clusters
in that area.

85
00:05:30,672 --> 00:05:32,984
With a ship that big,
he will be unable

86
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,541
to chart a course
that's less than ten parsecs.

87
00:05:36,157 --> 00:05:38,198
Looks like we're gonna have
to take a shortcut.

88
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:40,654
Admiral,
warn that station what's coming.

89
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:43,342
This journey may be treacherous.

90
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:46,403
If you lose any ships
before you reach the target...

91
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:48,030
We won't lose anybody.

92
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,392
I will come along
and fly fighter escort.

93
00:05:53,545 --> 00:05:55,230
Any help is welcome, Master Plo.

94
00:05:55,537 --> 00:05:57,068
Just try not to fall behind.

95
00:05:57,343 --> 00:05:59,143
I had a feeling
you'd be coming along.

96
00:05:59,297 --> 00:06:01,100
Your ship has already been prepped.

97
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,322
Even if we had the transports,

98
00:06:08,437 --> 00:06:12,198
it is not possible to evacuate
all of our wounded in time.

99
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:13,497
<i>You must try.</i>

100
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:16,061
<i>You won't stand a chance
against that battleship.</i>

101
00:06:16,303 --> 00:06:19,425
<i>Nala Se, I only just received word.
I've contacted the Naboo.</i>

102
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:22,580
<i>They are sending ships to help you,
and I am on my way as well.</i>

103
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,643
Thank you, Master Jedi.

104
00:06:24,758 --> 00:06:26,435
If they reach us in time,

105
00:06:26,724 --> 00:06:29,218
do you really think
they're going to stop that thing?

106
00:06:29,413 --> 00:06:31,247
It is our only hope.

107
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:44,497
Launch the fighters.

108
00:06:56,107 --> 00:06:57,994
<i>I hope you know
what you're doing, Anakin.</i>

109
00:06:58,108 --> 00:06:59,356
Well, if I don't,

110
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:01,738
<i>I won't be around
to hear the "I told you so. "</i>

111
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:03,070
That's reassuring.

112
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:06,001
Well, take your shortcut,
and I'll take the long way.

113
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:07,885
But you'd better be there
before I arrive.

114
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:09,325
<i>I'll be there, Obi-Wan.</i>

115
00:07:10,771 --> 00:07:12,409
Shadow squadron, tighten formation.

116
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:14,453
- Call in.
- Shadow 2 standing by.

117
00:07:14,605 --> 00:07:15,810
Shadow 3 standing by.

118
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,288
Shadow 4 standing by.

119
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:22,279
I know, "R2-ey. "
This is gonna be a tough one.

120
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:24,756
Cut the chatter, Ahsoka.

121
00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:26,274
Shadow 11 standing by.

122
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:27,792
Shadow 12 standing by.

123
00:07:33,676 --> 00:07:35,260
Fighter escort ready.

124
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:40,772
This is Admiral Yularan.
You are cleared for hyperspace jump.

125
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:42,927
<i>- Good hunting, sir.
- Thanks, Admiral.</i>

126
00:07:43,164 --> 00:07:44,845
<i>All right, boys, let's go.</i>

127
00:07:46,907 --> 00:07:49,558
Broadside, if we make it
through this one, drinks are on me.

128
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:51,236
I can already taste it.

129
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:07,151
What's taking so long?

130
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:10,892
I want to get there before too many
wounded clones escape.

131
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,964
Sorry, sir.

132
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:14,032
The navi-computer has had to calculate

133
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:18,784
a complex course around a large nebula
near the medical station.

134
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,415
They told me this ship was fast.

135
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,320
Okay, if we can just manage to navigate
through my shortcut, we'll be all right.

136
00:08:34,942 --> 00:08:38,793
A nebula can be very unpredictable.
I advise caution.

137
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,035
Don't worry about us, Master Jedi.
We can hold our own.

138
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:43,019
Right, Shadow squadron?

139
00:08:43,296 --> 00:08:44,424
Copy that, Shadow 2.

140
00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:46,860
Does anyone care
what the padawan thinks?

141
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:49,072
Of course we care, Snips.

142
00:08:49,187 --> 00:08:51,054
But we're still going
through that nebula.

143
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:54,090
Thanks, "R2-ey. "

144
00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:22,397
<i>The evacuation
is proceeding slowly, Madam.</i>

145
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:26,635
We will have to move
the patients in stable condition first.

146
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:30,181
The more critically injured
will have to wait.

147
00:09:30,698 --> 00:09:32,004
<i>What about the bacta tanks?</i>

148
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:33,780
<i>Many of those men
can't be moved at all.</i>

149
00:09:33,932 --> 00:09:35,258
I know, Commander.

150
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:38,436
Guide the patients that can be moved
onto transports

151
00:09:38,552 --> 00:09:40,609
as quickly as you can.

152
00:09:40,762 --> 00:09:42,090
<i>At once, Madam.</i>

153
00:09:48,144 --> 00:09:50,673
This soup is thick.
Can you see anything?

154
00:09:50,978 --> 00:09:52,869
Just keep your eyes
on my thruster, Shadow 2.

155
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,983
They'll have to.
The scanners are useless.

156
00:09:57,136 --> 00:09:58,701
This is old-fashioned flying.

157
00:09:59,112 --> 00:10:01,256
You have to feel your way through
to stay on course.

158
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,132
<i>Skywalker is right, Ahsoka.</i>

159
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:08,725
Clear your mind, young one,
and you will see the path.

160
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,400
Right now,
I can't see anything at all.

161
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:14,895
<i>I always know where I'm going.</i>

162
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,514
Yeah, where's that, Broadside?

163
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,910
I'm gonna blow up that battleship.

164
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:21,689
A clear path if ever there was one.

165
00:10:28,396 --> 00:10:32,249
Sir, the navi-computer indicates
we only have one parsec to go.

166
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:37,082
Good. We will maximize
our casualties with this attack.

167
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,197
General, there's an incoming
transmission from Count Dooku.

168
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:45,151
<i>General Grievous, I have received
intelligence from Lord Sidious.</i>

169
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,861
<i>The Republic has launched a small
strike force to attack the Malevolence.</i>

170
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:54,564
Let the Republic come.
Our ship is unstoppable.

171
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:57,505
<i>Skywalker is leading the mission.</i>

172
00:10:57,801 --> 00:11:00,100
<i>Do not underestimate him.</i>

173
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:05,432
I assure you, Count,
if anything, it is Skywalker

174
00:11:05,547 --> 00:11:08,435
who will underestimate
this ship and its power.

175
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,820
So, sky guy, how did you know
about this shortcut?

176
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:19,939
It's an old smuggler's route.

177
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:22,213
The pilots used to talk about it
on Tatooine.

178
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:23,672
Smuggler's route?

179
00:11:24,526 --> 00:11:25,846
That makes me feel better.

180
00:11:25,962 --> 00:11:28,107
<i>They call it the Balmorra run.</i>

181
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:29,698
Balmorra run?

182
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:31,797
I think I'm picking up a contact.

183
00:11:32,154 --> 00:11:35,312
Skywalker, listen to me.
We need to turn around.

184
00:11:35,693 --> 00:11:37,627
We can't,
not if we're gonna catch Grievous.

185
00:11:38,154 --> 00:11:40,983
Another contact.
This one's much larger.

186
00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:44,498
<i>Skywalker, Balmorra's the nesting
ground of the giant nebray mantis.</i>

187
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:46,691
Another. Another!

188
00:11:50,018 --> 00:11:51,168
Take evasive action!

189
00:12:01,018 --> 00:12:03,382
Those gas-gulpers are huge.

190
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:07,216
Don't shoot or they'll panic.

191
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:08,698
They'll panic?

192
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:10,091
I'm about to panic!

193
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,609
There are so many of them.

194
00:12:19,903 --> 00:12:22,471
I'm hit!
My stabilizer's out.

195
00:12:26,748 --> 00:12:28,023
Pull it together, Matchstick.

196
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:31,339
I'm okay.
I got it.

197
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:36,769
These things are gonna
make a meal out of us.

198
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:41,521
- All wings, line up behind me.
- Roger that, boss.

199
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:58,955
Hurry! They will not follow us
beyond the nebula.

200
00:13:00,726 --> 00:13:03,488
- That one looks hungry.
- Nah, it's just smiling at you.

201
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:13,476
We're coming out of it.

202
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,702
Let's hope your shortcut paid off.

203
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,825
We're not far behind Grievous now.

204
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:27,291
<i>The medical station reports
50% of patients evacuated.</i>

205
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:29,177
That's not good enough.

206
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:31,725
They'll never be finished
before the enemy arrives.

207
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:34,400
<i>General Skywalker still has a chance
to catch Grievous.</i>

208
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:36,478
If he does, we have to be ready.

209
00:13:36,904 --> 00:13:37,862
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

210
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,415
Shadow 2,
what is the damage to your ship?

211
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:52,932
Just a scratch, sir.

212
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:55,972
We must not take
any more unnecessary risks.

213
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,440
If we lose even a single ship,

214
00:13:58,554 --> 00:14:01,024
our mission is
that much closer to failure.

215
00:14:01,304 --> 00:14:03,924
Understood, Master Plo.
But we didn't lose any ships,

216
00:14:04,021 --> 00:14:05,388
<i>- and I didn't...
- Sir, another contact.</i>

217
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:07,038
I thought
those things wouldn't follow us.

218
00:14:07,327 --> 00:14:09,658
Not following.
Coming out of hyperspace.

219
00:14:09,755 --> 00:14:10,715
It's a ship.

220
00:14:11,097 --> 00:14:12,893
<i>It's the Malevolence.</i>

221
00:14:24,326 --> 00:14:26,663
A squadron of Republic fighters
is approaching.

222
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:28,125
Skywalker.

223
00:14:31,757 --> 00:14:34,277
Launch fighters
and bring the ship around.

224
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:37,871
There are several medical transports
surrounding the station.

225
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,663
Target the transports first.

226
00:14:49,777 --> 00:14:52,249
I want every single ship destroyed.

227
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:53,806
Roger, roger.

228
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,162
This is too easy.

229
00:15:16,922 --> 00:15:18,248
We've got fighters coming in.

230
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,557
<i>Steady, come on.
Hold it steady.</i>

231
00:15:25,945 --> 00:15:28,534
Charge the ion cannon
and prepare to fire.

232
00:15:28,985 --> 00:15:31,606
But, sir, our fighters
will be caught in the blast.

233
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:33,345
Fire at my command.

234
00:15:35,844 --> 00:15:37,139
Get those fighters off of us.

235
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:40,214
Your fancy flying
is making it difficult.

236
00:15:40,713 --> 00:15:41,533
Fire.

237
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:46,884
- Incoming!
- Make towards the edge of the ray, now!

238
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:51,717
Give it everything you've got.

239
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:56,750
Shadow 2, your speed is dropping.
What's wrong?

240
00:15:57,026 --> 00:15:59,185
Nothing, sir.
Just trying to keep it together.

241
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,175
You can make it, Matchstick.
Hang on.

242
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:07,036
Look out!

243
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:20,232
Shadow squadron, check in.

244
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:22,944
We lost Matchstick and Tag.

245
00:16:23,894 --> 00:16:26,401
<i>Shadow 6, 7, and 10
were caught in the ray.</i>

246
00:16:32,215 --> 00:16:33,532
It looks as though
Skywalker has failed.

247
00:16:34,223 --> 00:16:36,968
He's lost almost half his ships.
We should go, Madam.

248
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:38,803
I will stay.

249
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:46,113
Stay on course.

250
00:16:46,822 --> 00:16:47,950
This flak is heavy.

251
00:16:48,103 --> 00:16:49,587
All deflectors double front.

252
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:51,704
Master...

253
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,141
we need a new plan.

254
00:16:54,395 --> 00:16:56,098
We can make it, Ahsoka.
Hang in there.

255
00:17:00,372 --> 00:17:02,209
Sir, the enemy fighters are closing.

256
00:17:02,808 --> 00:17:06,290
Let them come.
Prepare the ion cannon.

257
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:09,100
First we will destroy
the medical station.

258
00:17:09,343 --> 00:17:11,793
Then we will finish off Skywalker.

259
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,071
I have a bad feeling about this.

260
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:17,386
Watch those towers, boys.

261
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:22,856
We're too close.
Loosen up.

262
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:31,603
lon cannon ready.

263
00:17:32,229 --> 00:17:34,438
They're targeting the station.
We're running out of time.

264
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,186
Master, you can make it,

265
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:40,349
but everyone else
is getting shot down.

266
00:17:41,855 --> 00:17:42,813
<i>Master!</i>

267
00:17:45,184 --> 00:17:46,779
Station has been targeted.

268
00:17:47,785 --> 00:17:50,214
Start the ion cannon acceleration.

269
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,980
If we can do enough damage,

270
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,763
the weapon may overload
when Grievous tries to fire.

271
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,232
Shadow squadron, new target.

272
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:06,390
<i>We're taking out
the starboard ion cannon.</i>

273
00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:13,458
lon cannon 75% charged.

274
00:18:13,756 --> 00:18:14,776
Hurry.

275
00:18:22,874 --> 00:18:23,841
Torpedoes away.

276
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:43,540
Fire!

277
00:18:58,311 --> 00:18:59,954
Good work, Shadow squadron.

278
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:01,584
<i>Nice job, Ahsoka.</i>

279
00:19:06,443 --> 00:19:07,687
Damage report.

280
00:19:08,017 --> 00:19:10,323
We've lost both primary weapons.

281
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:13,641
- The hyperdrive has been disabled.
- Impossible.

282
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:17,672
General, we are picking up three
Republic warships entering the system.

283
00:19:30,324 --> 00:19:32,243
<i>- Anakin, do you copy?
- I'm here.</i>

284
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:35,245
Congratulations. It looks like
your mission was a success.

285
00:19:35,786 --> 00:19:38,240
Partially, but Grievous is still alive.

286
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,700
The battle was pretty rough on my men.

287
00:19:40,814 --> 00:19:42,513
We're heading for the medical station.

288
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:45,202
We'll take it from here,
but don't worry.

289
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:48,351
<i>- We'll call when we need you.
- I'll be waiting, Obi-Wan.</i>

290
00:19:48,425 --> 00:19:52,098
All right, let's finish
what Anakin started. Ahead full.

291
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:55,304
Full retreat.

292
00:19:55,914 --> 00:19:57,731
Make for Separatist space.

293
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,938
Great job, Master Skywalker.

294
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:21,534
Your leadership skills
are most impressive.

295
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:23,371
You didn't do so bad yourself.

296
00:20:24,197 --> 00:20:25,278
Excuse me?

297
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:27,840
I believe it was my suggestion
to change the plan.

298
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:32,091
- That's kind of true, Snips.
- From a certain point of view.

299
00:20:38,511 --> 00:20:40,029
Make sure our ships are ready.

300
00:20:40,144 --> 00:20:42,758
We'll only have a short time
before Obi-Wan calls us for support.

301
00:20:42,965 --> 00:20:43,923
Yes, sir.

302
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,590
General Skywalker,
I wanted to thank you

303
00:20:50,704 --> 00:20:53,298
for your valiant effort today.

304
00:20:53,762 --> 00:20:56,424
Do not take the lives you saved lightly.

305
00:20:56,659 --> 00:21:00,195
I don't, but I also can't take
the lives I lost lightly.

306
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,260
I see.

307
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:06,050
If you will excuse me,
I must prepare for the coming battle.

308
00:21:10,293 --> 00:21:13,412
Your master is a very curious Jedi.

309
00:21:13,848 --> 00:21:15,449
He is one of a kind.
