Come with me!  What are you waiting for?!  Get in gear!\\n Artoo! Artoo-Detoo At last!  Where have you been?\\n They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do?  We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!\\n Wait a minute The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.\\n Where are those transmissions you intercepted?\\n We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah...  This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.\\n If this is a consular ship... where is the Ambassador?\\n Commander There she is! Set for stun!\\n She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.\\n Hey Don't call me a mindless philosopher Secret mission?  What plans?  What are you talking about?  I'm not getting in there!\\n I'm going to regret this.\\n There goes another one.\\n Hold your fire.  There are no life forms.  It must have been short-circuited.\\n That's funny Are you sure this things safe?\\n I've told you kids to slow down!\\n Did I hear a young noise blast through here?\\n It was just Wormie on another rampage.\\n Shape it up you guys!...  Biggs?\\n I didn't know you were back!  When did you get in?\\n Just now.  I wanted to surprise you The Academy didn't change you much... but you're back so soon?  Hey Of course I got it.  Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week.  First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service...... I just came back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.\\n I almost forgot.  There's a battle going on!  Right here in our system.  Come and look!\\n Not again!  Forget it.\\n There they are!\\n That's no battle But there was a lot of firing earlier...\\n Hey Don't worry about it I keep telling you Lord Vader Don't play games with me I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...\\n You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor.  Take her away!\\n Holding her is dangerous.  If word of this gets out I have traced the Rebel spies to her.  Now she is my only link to find their secret base!\\n you anything.\\n Leave that to me.  Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!\\n Lord Vader She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.  Send a detachment down to retrieve them.  See to it personally Yes How did I get into this mess?  I really don't know how.  We seem to be made to suffer.  It's our lot in life.\\n I've got to rest before I fall apart.  My joints are almost frozen. \\n What a desolate place this is.\\n Where are you going?\\n Well What makes you think there are settlements over there?\\n Don't get technical with me.\\n What mission?  What are you talking about?  I've had just about enough of you!  Go that way!  You'll be malfunctioning within a day And don't let me catch you following me begging for help No more adventures.  I'm not going that way.\\n That malfunctioning little twerp.  This is all his fault!  He tricked me into going this way Wait Over here!  Help!  Please ... so I cut off my power You ought to take it a little easy Luke.  You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley Look who's talking.  Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft in the city...\\n I've missed you kid.\\n Well Luke What are you talking about?\\n I made some friends at the Academy. ... when our frigate goes to one of the central systems Join the Rebellion?!  Are you kidding!  How?\\n Quiet down will ya!  You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!\\n I'm sorry.  I'm quiet. Listen how quiet I am.  You can barely hear me...\\n My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.\\n around forever trying to find them.\\n I know it's a long shot And I'm stuck here...\\n I thought you were going to the Academy next term.  You'll get your chance to get off this rock.\\n Not likely!  I had to cancel my application.  There has been a lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.\\n Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.\\n I know I feel for you It couldn't happen here.  You said it yourself.  The Empire won't bother with this rock.\\n Things always change.\\n I wish I was going...  Are you going to be around long? \\n No Then I guess I won't see you.\\n Maybe someday...  I'll keep a lookout.\\n Well So long Artoo-Detoo!  It's you!  It's you!\\n Someone was in the pod.  The tracks go off in this direction. \\n Look Wake up!  Wake up!\\n We're doomed.\\n Do you think they'll melt us down?\\n Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!  Will this never end?\\n Luke It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.\\n I have no need for a protocol droid.\\n Sir - not in an environment such as this - that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...\\n What I really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators.\\n Vaporators!  Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators.  You could say...\\n Do you speak Bocce?\\n Of course I can All right; shut up! I'll take this one.\\n Shutting up Luke But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...\\n You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.  Now All right Uncle Owen...\\n Yeah?\\n This R2 unit has a bad motivator.  Look!\\n Hey Excuse me Uncle Owen...\\n Yeah?\\n What about that one?\\n What about that blue one?  We'll take that one.\\n Yeah Uh Okay Now Thank the maker!  This oil bath is going to feel so good.  I've got such a bad case of dust contamination It just isn't fair.  Oh Is there anything I might do to help? \\n Well I don't think so Well I see Uh I see Just Luke.\\n And I am See-Threepio Hello.\\n You got a lot of carbon scoring here.  It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.\\n With all we've been through You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?\\n That's how we came to be in your service Have you been in many battles?\\n Several Well Help me What's this?\\n What is what?!?  He asked you a question...What is that?\\n Help me Oh Who is she?  She's beautiful.\\n I'm afraid I'm not quite sure Help me I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance Is there more to this recording?\\n Behave yourself He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi Obi-Wan Kenobi?  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?\\n I beg your pardon Well I wonder who she is.  It sounds like she's in trouble.  I'd better play back the whole thing.\\n He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt H'm?  Oh There you go.\\n Well been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! \\n Luke?  Luke!  Come to dinner!\\n All right I'm sorry Well Just you reconsider playing that message for him.\\n No No You know What makes you think that?\\n Well I thought he might have meant Ben.  Do you know what he's talking about?  Well That old man's just a crazy wizard.  Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.  That'll be the end of it.  It belongs to us now.\\n But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?\\n He won't He knew my father?\\n I told you to forget it.  Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow.  In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.\\n Yes You mean the next semester before harvest?\\n Sure Harvest is when I need you the most.  Only one more season.  This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands.  And then you can go to the Academy next year.\\n You must understand I need you here But it's a whole 'nother year.\\n Look Yeah Where are you going?\\n It looks like I'm going nowhere.  I have to finish cleaning those droids.\\n Owen I'll make it up to him next year.  I promise.\\n Luke's just not a farmer That's what I'm afraid of.\\n What are you doing hiding there?\\n It wasn't my fault Oh That R2 unit has always been a problem.  These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I can't understand their logic at times. \\n How could I be so stupid?  He's nowhere in sight.  Blast it!\\n Pardon me It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  We'll have to wait until morning.\\n Luke All right You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.\\n Oh Luke?  Luke?  Luke?  Where could he be loafing now!\\n Have you seen Luke this morning?\\n He said he had some things to do before he started today Uh?  Did he take those two new droids with him?\\n I think so.\\n Well How's that.\\n Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere Sir Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...\\n Deactivate!  Well Wait Hey Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission Well If you don't mind my saying so No What's wrong with him now?\\n Oh my... sir Sand People!  Or worse!  Come on There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second Hello there!  Come here my little friend.  Don't be afraid.\\n Don't worry What happened?\\n Rest easy Ben?  Ben Kenobi!  Boy The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me Oh Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan?  Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.\\n I think my uncle knew him.  He said he was dead.\\n Oh You know him!\\n Well of course Then the droid does belong to you.\\n Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.  Very interesting... \\n I think we better get indoors.  The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.\\n ... Threepio!\\n Where am I?  I must have taken a bad step...\\n Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before the Sand People return.\\n I don't think I can make it.  You go on No Quickly No That's what your uncle told you.  He didn't hold with your father's ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.\\n You fought in the Clone Wars?\\n Yes I wish I'd known him.\\n He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough Sir Sure What is it?\\n Your fathers lightsaber.  This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight.  Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.\\n An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times How did my father die?\\n A young Jedi named Darth Vader The Force?\\n Well Now I saw part of the message he was...\\n I seem to have found it.\\n General Kenobi You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.\\n Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home.  It's late I need your help I can't get involved!  I've got work to do!  It's not that I like the Empire.  I hate it!  But there's nothing I can do about it right now.  It's such a long way from here.\\n That's your uncle talking.\\n Oh Learn about the Force Look You must do what you feel is right Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.  The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.  They're more dangerous than you realize.\\n Dangerous to your starfleet The Rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate as long as....\\n The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.  I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.  The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.\\n That's impossible!  How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?\\n The regional governors now have direct control over territories.  Fear will keep the local systems in line.  Fear of this battle station.\\n And what of the Rebellion?  If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.\\n Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.  The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.\\n Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways I find your lack of faith disturbing.\\n Enough of this!  Vader As you wish.\\n This bickering is pointless.  Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.  We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.\\n It looks like Sand People did this They didn't.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.\\n These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.\\n And these blast points Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?\\n If they traced the robots here Wait Uncle Owen!  Aunt Beru!  Uncle Owen!\\n And There's nothing you could have done I want to come with you to Alderaan.  There's nothing here for me now.  I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.\\n Mos Eisley Spaceport.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  We must be cautious.\\n How long have you had these droids?\\n About three or four seasons.\\n They're for sale if you want them.\\n Let me see your identification.\\n You don't need to see his identification.\\n We don't need to see his identification.\\n looking for.\\n These are not the droids we're looking for.\\n He can go about his business.\\n You can go about your business.\\n Move along.\\n Move along.  Move along.\\n I can't abide these Jawas.  Disgusting creatures.\\n Go on The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.  You will find it a powerful ally.\\n Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?\\n Well I'm ready for anything.\\n Come along We don't serve their kind here!\\n What?\\n Your droids. They'll have to wait outside.  We don't want them here.\\n Listen I heartily agree with you sir.\\n Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?\\n He doesn't like you.\\n I'm sorry.\\n I don't like you either\\n Don't insult us.  You just watch yourself.  We're wanted men.  I have the death sentence on twelve systems.\\n I'll be careful than.\\n You'll be dead.\\n This little one isn't worth the effort.  Come let me buy you something...\\n No blasters!  No blaster!\\n This is Chewbacca.  He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.\\n I don't like the look of this.\\n Han Solo.  I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.\\n Yes Fast ship?  You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?\\n Should I have?\\n It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!\\n I've outrun Imperial starships Only passengers.  Myself What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?\\n Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.\\n Well Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!\\n But who's going to fly it You bet I could.  I'm not such a bad pilot myself!  We don't have to sit here and listen...\\n We haven't that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now Seventeen Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  We'll leave as soon as you're ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.\\n Ninety-four.\\n Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.\\n All right Seventeen thousand!  Those guys must really be desperate.  This could really save my neck.  Get back to the ship and get her ready.\\n You'll have to sell your speeder.\\n That's okay.  I'm never coming back to this planet again.\\n Going somewhere Yes It's too late.  You should have paid him when you had the chance.  Jabba's put a price on your head Yeah If you give it to me I don't have it with me.  Tell Jabba...\\n Jabba's through with you.  He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.\\n Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?\\n You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship.\\n Over my dead body.\\n That's the idea I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.\\n Yes Sorry about the mess.\\n Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.  It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.\\n The final check-out is complete.  All systems are operational.  What course shall we set?\\n Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.\\n What do you mean?\\n I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.\\n With pleasure.\\n Lock the door All right I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.  I don't know what all this trouble is about You watch your language!\\n He says it's the best he can do.  Since the XP-38 came out It will be enough.\\n If the ship's as fast as he's boasting Come on out I've been waiting for you I expected you would be.\\n I'm not the type to run.\\n Han You sent Greedo to blast me.\\n Han I think he thought he was.  Next time don't send one of those twerps.  If you've got something to say to me Han You know Put your blasters away.  Han Jabba What a piece of junk.\\n She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.  She may not look like much We're a little rushed Hello Which way?\\n All right Stop that ship!\\n Blast 'em!\\n Chewie Oh It looks like an Imperial cruiser.  Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.  Try and hold them off.  Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.\\n Stay sharp!  There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.\\n Why don't you outrun them?  I thought you said this thing was fast.\\n Watch your mouth Here's where the fun begins!\\n How long before you can make the jump to light speed?\\n It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.\\n Are you kidding?  At the rate they're gaining...\\n Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops What's that flashing?\\n We're losing our deflector shield.  Go strap yourself in We've entered the Alderaan system.\\n Governor Tarkin Charming to the last.  You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!\\n to take the responsibility yourself!\\n Princess Leia The more you tighten your grip Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way No!  Alderaan is peaceful.  We have no weapons.  You can't possibly...\\n You would prefer another target?  A military target?  Then name the system!\\n I grow tired of asking this.  So it'll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?\\n Dantooine.\\n They're on Dantooine.\\n There.  You see Lord Vader What?\\n You're far too trusting.  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.  But don't worry.  We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. \\n No!\\n Commence primary ignition.\\n Are you all right?  What's wrong?\\n I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened.\\n You'd better get on with your exercises.\\n Well Don't everyone thank me at once.\\n Anyway Now be careful He made a fair move.  Screaming about it won't help you.\\n Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.\\n But sir That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.\\n I see your point Remember You mean it controls your actions?\\n Partially. But it also obeys your commands.\\n Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side You don't believe in the Force Kid It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.\\n I suggest you try it again This time With the blast shield down Your eyes can deceive you.  Don't trust them.\\n Stretch out with your feelings.\\n You see I call it luck. \\n In my experience Look Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.\\n You know That's good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.\\n Yes.\\n Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.  They found the remains of a Rebel base She lied!  She lied to us!\\n I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.\\n Terminate her... immediately!\\n Stand by What the...?  Aw What's going on?\\n Our position is correct What do you mean?  Where is it?\\n Thats what I'm trying to tell you What?  How?\\n Destroyed... by the Empire!\\n The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...\\n There's another ship coming in.\\n Maybe they know what happened.\\n It's an Imperial fighter.\\n It followed us!\\n No.  It's a short range fighter.\\n There aren't any bases around here.  Where did it come from?\\n It sure is leaving in a big hurry.  If they identify us Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam it's transmissions.\\n It'd be as well to let it go.  It's too far out of range.\\n Not for long...\\n A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.\\n Then he must have gotten lost Well Look at him.  He's heading for that small moon.\\n I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.\\n That's no moon!  It's a space station.\\n It's too big to be a space station.\\n I have a very bad feeling about this.\\n Turn the ship around!\\n Yeah Why are we still moving towards it?\\n We're caught in a tractor beam!  It's pulling us in!\\n But there's gotta be something you can do!\\n There's nothin' I can do about it You can't win.  But there are alternatives to fighting.\\n Clear Bay twenty-three-seven.  We are opening the magnetic field.\\n To your stations!\\n Come with me.\\n Close all outboard shields!  Close all outboard shields!\\n Yes.\\n We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.  It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.\\n They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.  She may yet be of some use to us.\\n Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges.\\n There's no one on board Did you find any droids?\\n No Send a scanning crew on board.  I want every part of this ship checked.\\n Yes I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...\\n Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.  I want every part of this ship checked!\\n Boy I use them for smuggling.  I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them.  This is ridiculous.  Even if I could take off Leave that to me!\\n Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!\\n Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?\\n The ship's all yours.  If the scanners pick up anything Hey down there TX-four-one-two.  Why aren't you at your post?  TX-four-one-two Take over.  We've got a bad transmitter.  I'll see what I can do.\\n You know Bring them on!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.\\n We found the computer outlet Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.\\n He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here.  He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.\\n The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.  A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.\\n I don't think you boys can help.  I must go alone.\\n Whatever you say.  I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.\\n I want to go with you.\\n Be patient But he can...\\n They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.  Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.  The Force will be with you... always!\\n Boy you said it Where did you dig up that old fossil?\\n Ben is a great man.\\n Yeah I didn't hear you give any ideas...\\n Well Who do you think...\\n What is it?\\n I'm afraid I'm not quite sure Well Princess Leia.\\n The princess?  She's here?\\n Princess?\\n Where... where is she?\\n Princess?  What's going on?\\n Level five. Detention block AA-twenty-three.  I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.\\n Oh What are you talking about?\\n The droid belongs to her.  She's the one in the message.  We've got to help her.\\n Now But he didn't know she was here.  Look I'm not going anywhere.\\n They're going to execute her.  Look Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.\\n But they're going to kill her!\\n Better her than me...\\n She's rich.\\n Rich?\\n Yes.  Rich What?\\n Well more wealth that you can imagine.\\n I don't know You'll get it!\\n I better!\\n You will...\\n All right All right.\\n What's your plan?\\n Uh... Threepio Okay.  Now Okay.  Han Don't worry Master Luke Lock the door!\\n And hope they don't have blasters.\\n That isn't very reassuring.\\n I can't see a thing in this helmet.\\n This is not going to work.\\n Why didn't you say so before?\\n I did say so before!\\n Where are you taking this... thing?\\n Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight.\\n I wasn't notified.  I'll have to clear it.\\n Look out!  He's loose!\\n He's going to pull us all apart.\\n Go get him!\\n We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.  Here it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven.  You go get her.  I'll hold them here.\\n Everything is under control.  Situation normal.\\n What happened?\\n Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.  But We're sending a squad up.\\n Uh Who is this?  What's your operating number?\\n Boring conversation anyway.Luke!  We're going to have company!\\n Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?\\n What?  Oh... the uniform.  I'm Luke Skywalker.  I'm here to rescue you. \\n You're who?\\n I'm here to rescue you.  I've got your R2 unit.  I'm here with Ben Kenobi.\\n Ben Kenobi is here!  Where is he?\\n Come on!\\n He is here...\\n Obi-Wan Kenobi!  What makes you think so?\\n A tremor in the Force.  The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.\\n Surely he must be dead by now.\\n Don't underestimate the Force.\\n The Jedi are extinct Yes.\\n Governor Tarkin The princess!  Put all sections on alert!\\n Obi-Wan is here.  The Force is with him.\\n If you're right Escape may not his plan.  I must face him alone.\\n Chewie!\\n Get behind me!  Get behind me!\\n Can't get out that way.\\n Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.\\n Maybe you'd like it back in your cell See-Threepio!  See-Threepio!\\n Yes sir?\\n We've been cut off!  Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that?  I didn't copy!\\n I said Open up in there!\\n Oh There isn't any other way out.\\n I can't hold them off forever!  Now what?\\n This is some rescue.  When you came in here He's the brains Well What the hell are you doing?\\n Somebody has to save our skins.  Into the garbage chute Get in there you big furry oaf!  I don't care what you smell!  Get in there and don't worry about it.\\n Wonderful girl!  Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.  Get in there!\\n Oh!  The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.  What an incredible smell you've discovered!  Let's get out of here!  Get away from there...\\n No!  wait!\\n Will you forget it?  I already tried it.  It's magnetically sealed!\\n Put that thing away!  You're going to get us all killed.\\n Absolutely It could be worse...\\n It's worse.\\n There's something alive in here!\\n That's your imagination.\\n Something just moves past my leg!  Look!  Did you see that?\\n What?\\n Help!\\n Luke!  Luke!  Luke!\\n Luke!\\n Luke Blast it Where?\\n Anywhere!  Oh!!\\n Luke!  Luke!\\n Grab him!\\n What happened?\\n I don't know I've got a very bad feeling about this.\\n The walls are moving!\\n Don't just stand there.  Try and brace it with something.\\n Wait a minute!\\n Threepio!  Come in Threepio!  Threepio!  Where could he be?\\n Take over!See to him!  Look there!\\n They're madmen!  They're heading for the prison level.  If you hurry Follow me!  You stand guard.\\n Come on!\\n Oh!  All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here.  If you don't mind All right.\\n Threepio!  Come in Get to the top!\\n I can't \\n Where could he be?  Threepio!  Threepio They aren't here!  Something must have happened to them.  See if they've been captured.\\n Hurry!\\n One thing's for sure.  We're all going to be a lot thinner!Get on top of it!\\n I'm trying!\\n Thank goodness Use the comlink?  Oh Are you there Threepio!\\n We've had some problems...\\n Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.\\n Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.\\n No.  Shut them all down!  Hurry!\\n Listen to them!  They're dying Threepio We're all right.  You did great.\\n Hey... hey Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.\\n If we can just avoid any more female advice Well Where are you going?\\n No Come here Chewie!  Come here!\\n Listen. I don't know who you are Look It's a wonder you're still alive.Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?\\n No reward is worth this.\\n Secure this area until the alert is canceled.\\n Give me regular reports.\\n Do you know what's going on?\\n Maybe it's another drill.\\n What was that?\\n Oh There she is.\\n See-Threepio For the moment.  Uh We're right above you.  Stand by.\\n You came in that thing?  You're braver that I thought.\\n Nice!  Come on!\\n It's them!  Blast them!\\n Get back to the ship!\\n Where are you going?  Come back!\\n He certainly has courage.\\n What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?  Come on!\\n I think we took a wrong turn.\\n There's no lock!\\n That oughta hold it for a while.\\n Quick Oh They're coming through!\\n Here Here they come!\\n For luck!\\n Where could they be?\\n Close the blast doors!\\n Open the blast doors!  Open the blast doors!\\n I've been waiting for you When I left you Only a master of evil Your powers are weak You can't win Didn't we just leave this party?\\n What kept you?\\n We ran into some old friends.\\n Is the ship all right?\\n Seems okay Look!\\n Come on Now's our chance!  Go!\\n No!\\n Come on!\\n Come on!  Luke Blast the door!  Kid!\\n Run I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission We're coming up on the sentry ships.  Hold 'em off!  Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns!\\n I can't believe he's gone.\\n There wasn't anything you could have done.\\n Come on You in Here they come!\\n They're coming in too fast!\\n Oooh!\\n We've lost lateral controls.\\n Don't worry You hear me Got him!  I got him!\\n Great kid!  Don't get cocky.\\n There are still two more of them out there!\\n That's it!  We did it!\\n We did it!\\n Help!  I think I'm melting!This is all your fault.\\n Are they away?\\n They have just made the jump into hyperspace.\\n You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?  I'm taking an awful risk Not a bad bit of rescuing That doesn't sound too hard.  Besides Easy... you call that easy?\\n Their tracking us!\\n Not this ship At least the information in Artoo is still intact.\\n What's so important?  What's he carrying?\\n The technical readouts of that battle station.  I only hope that when the data is analyzed It is for me You needn't worry about your reward.  If money is all that you love Your friend is quite a mercenary.  I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.\\n I care!\\n So... what do you think of her I'm trying not to Good...\\n Still No!\\n You're safe!  We had feared the worst.\\n When we heard about Alderaan We don't have time for our sorrows Yes.\\n We are approaching the planet Yavin.  The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.  We are preparing to orbit the planet.\\n The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet.Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault.  A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.\\n Pardon me for asking Well The approach will not be easy.  You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.  The target area is only two meters wide.  It's a small thermal exhaust port Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.  The shaft is ray-shielded That's impossible It's not impossible.  I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home.  They're not much bigger than two meters.\\n Man your ships!  And may the Force be with you!\\n Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.  The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.\\n This will be a day long remembered.  It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.\\n All flight troops So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?\\n That's right Come on!  Why don't you take a look around?  You know what's about to happen What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides All right.  Well Hey What're you lookin' at?  I know what I'm doing.\\n What's wrong?\\n Oh He's got to follow his own path.  No one can choose it for him.\\n I only wish Ben were here.\\n Luke!  I don't believe it!  How'd you get here... are you going out with us?!\\n Biggs!  Of course Are you... Luke Skywalker?  Have you been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-five?\\n Sir I met your father once when I was just a boy.  He was a great pilot.  You'll do all right.  If you've got half of your father's skill Thank you I've got to get aboard.  Listen I told you I'd make it someday You did This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.  Do you want a new one?\\n Not on your life!  That little droid and I have been through a lot together.You okay Okay Hang on tight You wouldn't want my life to get boring Luke Stand-by alert.

Come with me!\\n Pull in!  Luke... pull in!\\n Watch your back Watch your back!  Fighter's above you I'm hit Artoo Red Six...\\n Can you see Red Five?\\n There's a heavy fire zone on this side. Red Five I can't shake him!\\n I'm on him Hold on!\\n Blast it!  Wedge where are you?\\n Thanks Good shooting Red Leader...\\n ... This is Gold Leader.  We're starting out attack run.\\n I copy Stay in attack formation!\\n The exhaust post is...\\n ... marked and locked in!\\n Switch power to front deflection screens.\\n How many guns do you think I'd say about twenty guns.

Increase speed full throttle!\\n What about that tower?\\n You worry about those fighters!  I'll worry about the tower!\\n Artoo... that I'm hit!  I can't stay with you.\\n Get clear You can't do any more good back there!\\n Sorry!\\n Let him go!

I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite  that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long.\\n Hey Aaargh!\\n Chewie!\\n All right Solo?\\n No sign of life out there Commander Skywalker reported in yet?\\n No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.\\n With all the meteor activity in this  system General I'm sorry to hear that.\\n Well A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good  fighter Thank you Well That's right.\\n Well Han!\\n Yes I thought you decided to stay.\\n Well Han We?\\n Yes.\\n Oh I need? I don't know what you're talking about.\\n You probably don't.\\n And what precisely am I supposed to know?\\n Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about  me.\\n Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader...\\n No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh -- uh huh! Come on.\\n You're imagining things.\\n Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave  without giving you a goodbye kiss?\\n I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.\\n I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!\\n Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the  thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know.\\n Oh Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us  out of here and you pull both of these.\\n Excuse me Put them back together right now.\\n Might I have a word with you What do you want?\\n Well I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.\\n Oh. Well I don't know where he is.\\n Nobody knows where he is.\\n What do you mean Well Deck Officer. Deck Officer!\\n Excuse me Yes Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?\\n I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the  south entrance.\\n It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out  there.\\n Yes Excuse me Why not?\\n Impossible man. Come along Sir Not likely. Are the speeders ready?\\n Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the  cold.\\n Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns.\\n Sir That's right. And my friends out in it.\\n I'll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set  screen alpha.\\n Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first  marker.\\n Then I'll see you in hell!\\n You must come along now Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke  again. He'll be quite all right Sir Mistress Leia Your Highness Close the doors.\\n Yes Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred  seventy-five...to one.\\n Actually Luke...Luke.\\n Ben?\\n You will go to the Dagobah system.\\n Dagobah system?\\n There you will learn from Yoda Ben...Ben.\\n Luke! Luke! Don't do this Not much time.\\n Ben...Ben...\\n Hang on Dagobah system...\\n Whew...\\n Dagobah...\\n This may smell bad Yoda...\\n ...but it will keep you warm...til I get the shelter built.   Ooh...I thought they smelled bad on the outside!\\n Echo Base...I've got something! Not much This is Rouge Two. this is Rouge Two. Captain  Solo Good morning. Nice of you guys to  drop by.\\n Echo Base...this is Rouge Two. I found  them. Repeat Master Luke Artoo expresses his relief How are you feeling Thanks to you.\\n That's two you owe me Well your Worship I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks  it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.\\n That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a  gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.\\n I don't know where you get you delusions Laugh it up She expressed her true feelings for me.\\n My...! Why Who's scruffy-looking?  I must have hit her pretty close  to the mark to get her all riled up like that Why Headquarters personnel Take it easy.\\n Excuse us Princess...we have a visitor.\\n We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve It's metal.\\n Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.\\n It could be a speeder No. Wait -- there's something very weak coming  through.\\n Sir It isn't friendly Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.\\n Afraid there's not much left.\\n What was it?\\n Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It  must have had a self-destruct.\\n An Imperial probe droid.\\n It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.\\n We'd better start the evacuation.\\n Admiral.\\n Yes I think we've got something We have thousands of probe droids searching the  galaxy. I want proof The visuals indicate life readings.\\n It could mean anything. If we followed every lead...\\n But You found something?\\n Yes That's it. The  Rebels are there.\\n My lord That is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set  your course for the Hoth system. General Veers Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the  speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded Right Okay Sir Well Take care Thanks.\\n Chewie Hi Yeah.\\n Be careful.\\n You General Reroute all power to the energy shield. We've got to hold  them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault.\\n What is it My lord The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel  came out of light-speed too close to the system.\\n He felt surprise was wiser...\\n He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General Yes Lord Vader You have failed me for the last time Yes Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and  deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now Thank you All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The  heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?\\n The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any  enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield Right. Okay.\\n Good luck.\\n Okay. Everyone to your stations. Let's go!\\n Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to  open the shield.\\n Sir Good. Our first catch of the day.\\n Stand by The first transport is away.\\n Feeling all right Just like new Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself.\\n I know what you mean.\\n Echo Station Three-T-Eight.\\n We have spotted Imperial walkers!\\n Imperial walkers on the north ridge.\\n Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.\\n All right Luke Steady All right Hobbie That armor's too strong for blasters.\\n Rouge Group Luke Just hang on. Hang on Dack? Dack!\\n Yes Rouge Three.\\n Copy Wedge Coming around Steady Activate harpoon.\\n Good shot One more pass.\\n Coming around. Once more.\\n One more.\\n Cable out! Let her go!\\n Detach cable.\\n Cable detached.\\n Come on!\\n Whooha!! That got him!\\n I see it I don't think we can protect two transports at a time.\\n It's risky Launch patrols.\\n Evacuate remaining ground staff.\\n No Artoo All troops will debark for ground assault. Prepare to target  the main generator.\\n Rouge Two Yeah. I'm with you We'll set harpoon. I'll cover for you.\\n Coming around.\\n Watch that cross fire Set for position three.  Steady.\\n Stay tight and low.\\n Hobbie You all right?\\n Why are you still here?\\n I heard the command center had been hit.\\n You got your clearance to leave.\\n Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship.\\n Your Highness Send all troops in sector twelve to the south  slope to protect the fighters.\\n Imperial troops have entered the base.\\n Come on...that's it.\\n Give the evacuation code signal. And get to  your transports!\\n K-one-zero...all troops disengage.\\n Oh! Wait for me!\\n Begin retreat!\\n Fall back!\\n Distance to power generators?\\n One-seven Target. Maximum fire power.\\n Transport But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!!\\n Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop!\\n How typical.\\n Come on.\\n Hurry up Wait! Wait!\\n How's this?\\n Would it helped if I got out and pushed?\\n It might.\\n Captain Solo It can wait.\\n The bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.\\n This baby's got a few surprises left in her Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a  burnout.\\n See?\\n Someday you're going to be wrong Punch it!\\n Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff.\\n Good luck Don't worry There's nothing wrong We're not going to regroup with the others.\\n We're going to the Dagobah system.\\n Yes That's all right. I'd like to keep it  on manual control for a while.\\n I saw them! I saw them!\\n Saw what?\\n Star Destroyers Sir Shut him up or shut him down!  Check the  deflector shield!\\n Oh Take evasive action!\\n Prepare to make the jump to light-speed.\\n But They're getting closer!\\n Oh yeah? Watch this.\\n Watch what?\\n I think we're in trouble.\\n If I may say so We're in trouble!\\n Horizontal boosters...!\\n Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it.\\n Bring me the hydrospanners!\\n I don't know how we're going to get out of this one.\\n Oww! Chewie!\\n That was no laser blast! Something hit us.\\n Han Come on Asteroids!\\n Oh What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid  field?\\n They'd be crazy to follow us You don't have to do this to impress me.\\n Sir Never tell me the odds!\\n You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out  here much longer.\\n I'm not going to argue with that.\\n Pulverized?\\n I'm going in closer to one of the big ones.\\n Closer?\\n Closer?!\\n Oh There. That looks pretty good.\\n What looks pretty good?\\n Yeah. That'll do nicely.\\n Excuse me I hope you know what you're doing.\\n Yeah Yes No Yes I know No Artoo?\\n Artoo! Where are you?\\n Artoo! You be more careful.\\n Artoo -- that way!\\n Artoo!\\n Oh If you're saying coming here was a bad idea Yes Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon Asteroids do not concern me Yes I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power  systems.\\n Sir No Sir Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these  things.  Chewie Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After  all Let go.\\n Sshh!\\n Let go Don't get excited.\\n Captain Sorry Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there.  There you go.\\n Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even  exists.\\n Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel  like...I don't know...\\n Feel like what?\\n Like we're being watched!\\n Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm.\\n I am wondering I'm looking for someone.\\n Looking? Found someone Right.\\n Help you I can. Yes I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.\\n Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not  make one great.\\n Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner.\\n How you get so big Listen Aww Hey Mine! Or I will help you not.\\n I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get  out of this slimy mudhole.\\n Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is.\\n Ah Oh Mine! Mine!\\n Artoo!\\n Mine!\\n Mine!\\n Now will you move along No! No I'm not looking for a friend Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda.\\n You know him?\\n Mmm. Take you to him Come Stay here and watch after the camp Oh Sir Well Here! And Chewie...\\n ...I think we'd better replace the negative power  coupling.\\n Hey Would you please stop calling me that?\\n Sure Oh I do Occasionally  maybe...when you aren't  acting like a scoundrel.\\n Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.\\n Stop that.\\n Stop what?\\n Stop that! My hands are dirty.\\n My hands are dirty Afraid?\\n You're trembling.\\n I'm not trembling.\\n You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough  scoundrels in your life.\\n I happen to like nice men.\\n I'm a nice man.\\n No Sir Thank you. Thank you very much.\\n Oh ...and that No Lord Vader.\\n Yes The Emperor commands you make contact with him.\\n Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a  clear transmission.\\n Yes What is thy bidding There is a great disturbance in the Force.\\n I have felt it.\\n We have a new enemy -- Luke Skywalker.\\n Yes He could destroy us.\\n He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.\\n The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not  become a Jedi.\\n If he could be turned Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done?\\n He will join us or die Look Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?\\n Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him.   Rootleaf Mostly because of my father Ah Oh I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.\\n He will learn patience.\\n Hmmm. Much anger in him Was I any different when you taught me?\\n Hah. He is not ready.\\n Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben Ready So was I He is too old. Yes But I've learned so much.\\n Will he finished what he begins?\\n I won't fail you -- I'm not afraid.\\n Oh Sir I'm not really interested in your opinion There's something out there.\\n Where?\\n Outside There it is. Listen! Listen!\\n I'm going out there.\\n Are you crazy?!\\n I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let  something tear it apart.\\n Then I'm going with you.\\n I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the  ship.  Oh This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at  all.\\n There's an awful lot of moisture in here.\\n I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.\\n Yeah.\\n Watch out!\\n Yeah Mynocks?\\n Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.\\n Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo!\\n Wait a minute...\\n All right The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to...\\n No time to discuss this as a committee.\\n I am not a committee!\\n You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field...\\n Sit down Look!\\n I see it We're doomed!\\n The cave is collapsing.\\n This is no cave.\\n What?\\n Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of  the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow Vader. Is the dark side stronger?\\n No...no...no. Quicker But how am I to know the good side from the bad?\\n You will know. When you are calm But tell me why I can't...\\n No There's something not right here.\\n I feel cold That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain  of evil it is. In you must go.\\n What's in there?\\n Only what you take with you.\\n Your weapons...you will not need them.\\n Bounty hunters. We don't need that scum.\\n Yes Those Rebels won't escape us.\\n Sir Right.\\n ...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds  the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary As you wish.\\n Lord Vader! My lord Oh Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three!\\n It's not fair!\\n The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault!\\n No light-speed?\\n It's not my fault.\\n Sir Turn her around.\\n I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front  shield.\\n You're going to attack them?!\\n Sir Shut up!\\n They're moving to attack position. Shields up!\\n Track them Captain Needa They can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking  device.\\n Well Captain Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full  responsibility for losing them Yes Use the Force. Yes...\\n Now...the stone. Feel it.\\n Concentrate!\\n Oh So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you  nothing that I say?\\n Master No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn  what you have learned.\\n All right No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.\\n I can't. It's too big.\\n Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a  powerful ally it is. Life creates it You want the impossible.\\n I don't...I don't believe it.\\n That is why you fail.\\n Apology accepted Lord Vader Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along  their last know trajectory.\\n Yes Don't fail me again Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.\\n Captain Solo The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand  by the manual release for the landing claw.\\n I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a  perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...\\n Thank you.\\n What did you have in mind for your next move?\\n Well With the rest of the garbage. Then what?\\n Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any  ideas?\\n No. Where are we?\\n The Anoat system.\\n Anoat system. There's not much there.\\n No. Well Lando system?\\n Lando's not a system Thanks.\\n Bespin. It's pretty far A mining colony?\\n Yeah Can you trust him?\\n No. But he has no love for the Empire Here we go You do have your moments. Not many Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm Han! Leia!\\n Hmm. Control I saw...I saw a city in the clouds.\\n Mmm. Friends you have there.\\n They were in pain.\\n It is the future you see.\\n Future? Will they die?\\n Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.\\n I've got to go to them.\\n Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now No Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain.\\n You will not deviate from your present course.\\n Rather touchy I thought you knew this person.\\n Well Permission granted to land on Platform  Three-two-seven.\\n Thank you.\\n There's nothing to worry about. We go way back Who's worried?\\n Oh. No one to meet us.\\n I don't like this.\\n Well Well Look See? My friend.  Keep your eyes open Why How you doing Well Yes...very friendly.\\n What are you doing here?\\n Ahh...repairs. I thought you could  help me out.\\n What have you done to my ship?\\n Your ship? Hey Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm  the administrator of this facility. and who might you be?\\n Leia.\\n Welcome All right Hello Well What's wrong with the Falcon?\\n Hyperdrive.\\n I'll get my people to work on it.\\n Good.\\n You know How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you?\\n Oh You. Listen to you -- you sound like a businessman You know Yeah.\\n Yeah Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.\\n E chu ta!\\n How rude!\\n That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if...\\n Hello? How interesting. Oh Who are you?\\n Oh Luke! You must complete the training.\\n I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've  got to help them.\\n You must not go!\\n But Han and Leia will die if I don't.\\n You don't know that.\\n Even Yoda cannot see their fate.\\n But I can help them! I feel the Force!\\n But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you Yes But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your  friends are made to suffer.\\n And that is why I have to go.\\n Luke You won't.\\n Stopped they must be. On this depends. Only a fully trained Jedi  Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now Patience.\\n And sacrifice Han and Leia?\\n If you honor what they fight for...yes!\\n If you choose to face Vader I understand.  Artoo Luke Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.\\n I will. And I'll return. I promise.\\n Told you That boy is our last hope.\\n No. There is another.\\n The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're  in great shape.\\n The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen  or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.\\n Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.\\n I don't trust Lando.\\n Well And then you're as good as gone What happened?\\n Where? Found him in a junk pile?\\n Oh Lando's got people who can fix him.\\n No I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything?\\n Not really.\\n You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us  among the clouds.\\n Thank you.\\n Will you join me for a little refreshment?\\n Everyone's invited Having trouble with you droid?\\n No. No problem. Why?\\n So you see So you're part of the mining guild then?\\n No Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this  little operation and shut you down?\\n That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over  everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever.\\n We would be honored if you would join us.\\n I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry.\\n I'm sorry No Just hang on. We're almost there.\\n Mmmm. Oh Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the  others. Oh Lord Vader.\\n You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I  have Skywalker.\\n He's no good to me dead.\\n He will not be permanently damaged.\\n Lord Vader They must never again leave this city.\\n That was never a condition of our agreement Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.\\n No.\\n Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison  here.\\n This deal's getting worse all the time.\\n Oh I feel terrible.\\n Why are they doing this?\\n They never even asked me any questions.\\n Lando.\\n Get out of here Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie  over to me.\\n Over to you?\\n They'll have to stay here What about Han?\\n Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.\\n Vader wants us all dead.\\n He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called  Skywalker.\\n Luke?\\n Lord Vader has set a trap for him.\\n And we're the bait.\\n Well Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better Yeah You certainly have a way with people.\\n This facility is crude Lord Vader Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.\\n Lord Vader I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on  Captain Solo.\\n If only you had attached my legs What's going on...buddy?\\n You're being put into carbon freeze.\\n What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me.\\n The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!\\n Oh Stop Yes Chewie! Chewie Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess -- you  have to take care of her. You hear me?\\n I love you!\\n I know.\\n What...what's going on? Turn around Well Yes He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.\\n Skywalker has just landed Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision.\\n I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.\\n Luke! Luke The Force is with you Well done. Hold them in the security tower -- and keep it  quiet. Move.\\n What do you think you're doing?\\n We're getting out of here.\\n I knew all along it had to be a mistake.\\n Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust  you?\\n I had no choice...\\n What are you doing? Trust him Oh I'm just trying to help...\\n We don't need any of your help.\\n H-a-a-a...\\n What?\\n It sounds like Han.\\n There's still a chance to save Han...I mean Chewie.\\n I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.\\n Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been?\\n Turn around Well Oh You have learned much You'll find I'm full of surprises.\\n Your destiny lies with me No!\\n All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor  thought.\\n Impressive...most impressive.\\n Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear...  now release your anger.\\n Only your hatred can destroy me.\\n The security codes has been changed!\\n Artoo Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes  control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive.\\n This way.\\n Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know  a power socket from a computer terminal.\\n What are you talking about? We're not interested in the  hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!\\n Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt Leia! Go!\\n I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of  course You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be  destroyed as Obi-Wan did.\\n There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet  realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength I'll never join you!\\n If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told  you what happened to your father.\\n He told me enough! He told me you killed him.\\n No. I am your father.\\n No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!\\n Search your feelings. You know it to be true.\\n No! No! No!\\n Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is  your destiny. Join me Ben...Ben Ben. Leia!\\n Hear me! Leia!\\n Luke...We've got to go back.\\n What?\\n I know where Luke is.\\n But what about those fighter?\\n Chewie But what about Vader?\\n All right Bring my shuttle.\\n Look It's Luke. Chewie Okay. Easy Lando?\\n Okay Oh All right I'll be back.\\n Star Destroyer.\\n All right If your people fixed the hyperdrive.\\n All the coordinates are set. It's now or never.\\n Punch it!\\n They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not  my fault!\\n They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium  Falcon?\\n Yes Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for  stun.\\n Yes Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed?\\n We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated?\\n The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo Luke.\\n Father.\\n Son Ben Chewie!\\n It's Vader.\\n Luke...it is your destiny.\\n Ben Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam.\\n Artoo Oh Luke Good luck When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty  hunter I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on  Tatooine.\\n Princess Chewie Take care Ow!\\n Command station The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to proceed.\\n We're starting our approach.\\n Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.\\n Yes Lord Vader You may dispense with the pleasantries I assure you Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.\\n I tell you The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.\\n But he asks the impossible. I need more men.\\n Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.\\n The Emperor's coming here?\\n That is correct We shall double our efforts.\\n I hope so Of course I'm worried. And you should be Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt Artoo There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke.\\n Tee chuta hhat yudd!\\n Goodness gracious me!\\n Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.\\n I don't think they're going to let us in Artoo Oh Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh Die Wanna Wanga!\\n Oh ... and a gift.  Gift Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.\\n He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.\\n I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things.\\n Nudd Chaa.\\n Artoo Good morning.\\n Bo Shuda!\\n The message Greetings What did he say?\\n ... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.\\n This can't be! Artoo There will be no bargain.\\n We're doomed.\\n I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is.\\n Artoo What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!\\n Ah I am See-Threepio Yes or no will do.\\n Oh. Well How many languages do you speak?\\n I am fluent in over six million forms of communication Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.\\n Disintegrated?\\n Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.\\n Artoo You're a feisty little one Da Eitha!\\n Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...\\n Boscka!\\n I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.\\n Oh At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.\\n Oh Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty- five thousand.\\n I want fifty thousand. No less.\\n Uh Because he's holding a thermal detonator.\\n This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.\\n Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.\\n Zeebuss.\\n He agrees!\\n Just relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite.\\n Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.\\n I can't see.\\n You eyesight will return in time.\\n Where am I?\\n Jabba's palace.\\n Who are you?\\n Someone who loves you.\\n Leia!\\n I gotta get you out of here.\\n What's that? I know that laugh.\\n Hey It's too late for that Look...\\n Take him away!\\n Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!\\n Bring her to me.\\n We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...\\n I'm sure.\\n Ugh!\\n Ohhh Chewie? Chewie Ah! Chew--Chewie!\\n Wait. I can't see Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while I'm all right I must speak with Jabba.\\n You will take me to Jabba now!\\n You serve your master well.\\n And you will be rewarded.\\n At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.\\n Master.\\n ...Luke Skywalker I told you not to admit him.\\n I must be allowed to speak.\\n He must be allowed to speak.\\n You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.\\n You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.\\n Your mind powers will not work on me Nevertheless Master Luke There will be no bargain Bascka!\\n Oh Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage.\\n Han!\\n Luke!\\n Are you all right?\\n Fine. Together again Wouldn't miss it.\\n How are we doing?\\n The same as always.\\n That bad I'm here.\\n Oh Good You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon Doesn't sound so bad.\\n In his belly On second thought You should have bargained I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur There's nothing to see. I used to live here You're gonna die here Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.\\n Oh... great!\\n Soon you will learn to appreciate me.\\n Oh Well Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.\\n Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy Threepio Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.\\n Move him into position.\\n Put him in.\\n Easy Whoa! Whoa! Help!\\n Chewie I'm okay Han! Chewie?\\n Lando!\\n Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?\\n Lando Lower it!\\n I'm trying!\\n Whoa! Whoa! Grab me Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!\\n Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!\\n Hold it! Whoa!\\n Gently now. All... all right. Now easy Chewie! Chewie No It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.\\n All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!\\n Chewie Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.\\n Not my eyes! Artoo Get the gun! Point it at the deck!\\n Point it at the deck!\\n Artoo Come on!\\n Let's go! And don't forget the droids.\\n We're on our way.\\n I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!\\n That's all any of us can see.\\n Then I guess I'm getting better.\\n I've got to hand it to you I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.\\n No I'll see you back at the fleet.\\n Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?\\n I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.\\n Guess I owe you some thanks Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life He means \\\\You're welcome.\\\\\\n Come on I'll meet you back at the fleet.\\n Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.\\n I will.\\n Hey That's right Rise The Death Star will be completed on schedule.\\n You have done well Yes Patience As you wish.\\n Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.\\n Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?\\n No... of course not.\\n I do Soon will I rest. Yes Master Yoda Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things ... the way of the Force.\\n But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.\\n No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.\\n Then I am a Jedi?\\n Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?\\n Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.\\n Yoda Your father he is.\\n Told you Yes.\\n Unexpected this is Unfortunate that I know the truth?\\n No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you.\\n Well Remember Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor I can't do it Yoda will always be with you.\\n Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?\\n You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.\\n You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened A certain point of view!\\n Luke I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did Anakin was a good friend.\\n When I first knew him There's still good in him.\\n I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.\\n I can't do it You cannot escape your destiny.\\n I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.\\n Vader humbled you when first you met him But I had to help my friends.\\n And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely I found out Darth Vader was my father.\\n To be a Jedi I can't kill my own father.\\n Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.\\n Yoda spoke of another.\\n The other he spoke of is your twin sister.\\n But I have no sister.\\n Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor Leia! Leia's my sister.\\n Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down When your father left The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted But you can't let her get involved now She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have Well Oh Well I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.\\n Well The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.\\n The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack\\n Good luck.\\n You're gonna need it.\\n General Madine.\\n We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship Sounds dangerous.\\n I wonder who they found to pull that off.\\n General Solo Uh Well That's one.\\n Uh I'm with you What is it?\\n Ask me again sometime.\\n Luke.\\n Hi \\\\Exciting\\\\ is hardly the word I would use.\\n Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.\\n All right Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.\\n Look Good luck.\\n You You got her warmed?\\n Yeah No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her Hey Yeah Come on Right. Chewie All set.\\n Here we go again.\\n All right What is thy bidding Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.\\n What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?\\n It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished Yes If they don't go for this We have you on our screen now. Please identify.\\n Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.\\n Shuttle Tydirium Transmission commencing.\\n Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.\\n It'll work. It'll work.\\n Vader's on that ship.\\n Now don't get jittery I don't know.  Fly casual.\\n I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.\\n It's your imagination Where is that shuttle going?\\n Shuttle Tydirium Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.\\n Do they have a code clearance?\\n It's an older code Shall I hold them?\\n No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.\\n As you wish They're not goin' for it Shuttle Tydirium Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.\\n Oh Shall we try and go around?\\n It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.\\n Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.\\n Quietly Hey... it's me.\\n Go for help! Go!\\n Great. Come on.\\n Over there! Two more of them!\\n I see them. Wait Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!\\n Hey Move closer!\\n Get alongside that one!\\n Get him!\\n Keep on that one! I'll take these two!\\n Oh Luke! Where's Leia?\\n What? She didn't come back?\\n I thought she was with you.\\n We got separated.\\n Hey Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.\\n Come on Don't worry And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!\\n Cut it out!\\n I'm not gonna hurt you.\\n Well Well I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.\\n All right. You want something to eat?\\n That's right. Come on. Hmmm?\\n Look What is it?\\n Freeze!  Come on Go get your ride and take her back to base.\\n Yes Come on Halt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment.\\n The Emperor will see me The Emperor will see you I told you to remain on the command ship.\\n A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.\\n Yes My son is with them.\\n Are you sure?\\n I have felt him Strange They are clear Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.\\n He will come to me?\\n I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you and then you will bring him before me.\\n As you wish.\\n Luke! Luke!\\n Oh There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.\\n I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.\\n I hope she's alright.\\n What Hey Nah Chewie Nice work. Great Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han Yeah Artoo Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else.\\n Hey!\\n Han Chewie Oh Do you understand anything they're saying?\\n Oh What are you telling them?\\n Hello Well I beg your pardon Proper?!\\n It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.\\n Why My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.\\n I have a really bad feeling about this.\\n What did he say?\\n I'm rather embarrassed Leia!\\n Oh!\\n Your Royal Highness.\\n But these are my friends. Threepio Somehow Threepio But Master Luke Just tell them.\\n You see ... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody Oh Thanks I...I never knew I had it in me.\\n Yes What's going on?\\n I don't know.\\n Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.\\n Just what I always wanted.\\n Well He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.\\n Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies And hurry up Luke Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?\\n Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.\\n What do you remember?\\n Just...images Tell me.\\n She was very beautiful. Kind I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.\\n Luke Vader is here...now How do you know?\\n I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go.  As long as I stay Why?\\n He's my father.\\n Your father?\\n There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it Luke You're wrong Yes. It's you Leia.\\n I know. Somehow...I've always known.\\n Then you know why I have to face him.\\n No! Luke No But Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.\\n Hey Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.\\n Nothing?  Come on I...I can't tell you.\\n Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?\\n I...\\n Ahhh...\\n I'm sorry.\\n Hold me.\\n This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it He was armed only with this.\\n Good work Yes The Emperor has been expecting you.\\n I know So I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker That name no longer has any meaning for me.\\n It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.\\n I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.\\n Your skills are complete. Indeed Come with me.\\n Obi-Wan once thought as you do.\\n You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.\\n I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.\\n If that is your destiny.\\n Search your feelings It is too late for me Then my father is truly dead.\\n The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.\\n Hey What's he saying?\\n He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.\\n Admiral Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.\\n Don't worry All craft All right. Stand by.\\n Back door It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.\\n Well Then we'll do it real quiet-like.\\n Oh! Oh Quiet.\\n I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.\\n Oh There goes our surprise attack.\\n Look! Over there! Stop him!\\n Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this.\\n I have decided that we shall stay here.\\n Welcome You no longer need those.\\n Guards I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master.\\n You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.\\n Oh His lightsaber.\\n Ah You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.\\n Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.\\n Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.\\n Your overconfidence is your weakness.\\n Your faith in your friends is yours.\\n It is pointless to resist Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design.  Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon...\\n ...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them.\\n Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.\\n All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.\\n Charges!  Come on Oh Wa-wait! Wait Freeze! You Rebel scum.\\n All wings report in.\\n Red Leader standing by.\\n Gray Leader standing by.\\n Green Leader standing by.\\n Lock S-foils in attack positions.\\n May the Force be with us.\\n We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield Break off the attack! The shield is still up.\\n I get no reading. Are you sure?\\n Pull up! All craft pull up!\\n Take evasive action! Green Group Admiral It's a trap!\\n Fighters coming in.\\n There's too many of them!\\n Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers.\\n Copy Come From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance You want this No!\\n It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You All right Hello! I say Bring those two down here!\\n Let's go!\\n Well Freeze! Don't move!\\n We surrender.\\n Ohhh! Stand back The code's changed. We need Artoo!\\n Here's the terminal.\\n Artoo Going? What do you mean Watch yourself Red Three Got it!\\n Three of them coming in Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate.\\n Pressure's steady.\\n Only the fighters are attacking.  I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for.\\n We're in attack position now Hold here.\\n We're not going to attack?\\n I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.\\n As you can see Fire!\\n That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational!  Home One We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.\\n You won't get another chance at this We have no choice Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.\\n We're coming!\\n Come on! Come on!\\n Oh My goodness! Artoo Well I'll cover you.\\n Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point- blank range.\\n At that close range We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.\\n She's gonna blow!\\n I'm hit!\\n Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless.  Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred Look!\\n Get him off of there!\\n I think I got it. I got it!\\n Oh Let's see.\\n It's not bad.\\n Freeze!\\n Oh Don't move!\\n I love you.\\n I know.\\n Hands up! Stand up!\\n Stay back.\\n Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No Good.  Use your aggressive feelings Obi-Wan has taught you well.\\n I will not fight you You are unwise to lower your defenses.\\n Your thoughts betray you There is no conflict.\\n You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight Good.  Good.\\n Watch out. Squad at .06.\\n I'm on it Good shot Now...come on It's over Send three squads to help. Open the back door.\\n Yes Throw me another charge.\\n You cannot hide forever I will not fight you.\\n Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her Never-r-r!\\n Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed So be it...Jedi.\\n Move! Move!\\n The shield is down! Commence attack on the Death Star's main reactor.\\n We're on our way. Red Group If you will not be turned Young fool...only now Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision.\\n Father Now I'm going in.\\n Here goes nothing.\\n Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.\\n Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.\\n Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you.\\n Copy That was too close.\\n We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.\\n Sir Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through.\\n Intensify forward firepower!\\n It's too late!\\n Luke But you'll die.\\n Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes.\\n Now...go No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you.\\n You already have Father... I won't leave you.\\n There it is!\\n All right Copy Move the fleet away from the Death Star.\\n Wedge You'll make it. Just follow me Gold Leader.\\n I promised to return his ship without a scratch...I sure hope that old pirate forgives me.\\n Lando...\\n They did it!\""
